<br><strong>PROLOGUE<A name=prologue></A></strong>
<br>Remembering his high task, set to him by Divine Providence, the
author of "Initiation into Hermetics" here delivers to sincere
seekers after truth his second work, "The Practice of Magical
Evocation".
<br><br>In this second book he shows the next stages of the magical
path to all those students who were able to start their magical
development by means of the first volume. He points out clearly
that there should not be any rest nor repose on the way, since this
would undoubtedly mean a relapse to stagnation, to ignorance
and thus to spiritual darkness. There may only be progress, onward
to those "brilliant heights" which are in store for all those
who spare no effort, taking in hand courageously and unflinchingly
their spiritual ascent. This book is a means for this aim.
We are indepted to the author for pointing out very clearly to
his disciples the host of dangers which lie in wait, and which can
lead him astray for a long time or even for his whole lifetime.
<br><br>No book of the past or the present about this knowledge gives a
picture as true and clear as this book does. The author is able to
express in simple words the deepest knowledge and furthermore
he describes a series of strange and wonderful occurrences and
events on our planet as well as in various worlds and zones
around us.
<br><br>Thousandfold thanks may meet Divine Providence for her
great grace, and the author sent by her, from all readers and true
disciples of the highest knowledge.
<br><br>All those can be happy who hold this book in their hands. May
they keep it well and follow true and conscientious these precious
teachings.

<br><strong>INTRODUCTION<A name=intro></A></strong>
<br>During the course of time, especially during recent centuries,
many books have been written and published about magic, but
usually in such a misleading and incomplete manner that only little
of what they contain can be used for practical work, and this
only in small fragments. From the prime origin only a few
societies were able to initiate the student into hermetic science, or
magic, and since then this science has remained something entirely
restricted to specially selected persons. And therefore necessarily
also a dark and mysterious matter to those anxiously looking
for truth.
<br><br>During the Middle Ages knowledge of magic was repeatedly
strongly attacked by various religious orders, the inquisitions of
history being the most striking example of this. Later, at the
beginning of the modern age, magic was regarded as pure superstition,
and any person showing a slight inclination to this kind of
science was ridiculed. Mystical sects and others were responsible
for the ill name the study of magic soon got, and people showing
interest in it were usually put into the pillory "for practising
black magic".
<br><br>True magic was taught in the oldest prophetic schools and in
secluded circles to which only initiates had access. The small
number of books giving scant information on magic were compiled
in such a manner that their contents would offer little even to
the most attentive reader, making a full apprehension of the
science entirely impossible.
<br><br>According to the old Egyptian mysteries, magic corresponds to
the second tarot-card, displaying a priestess. I am
willing to show the right way to the serious and diligent student
who is free of any fanatical religion or mistaken conception of the
world and who is prepared to penetrate deep into the mysteries of
hermetic science, or magic.
<br><br>Like my first work this book has been written in a colloquial
and easy to read style. This is so that even the simplest man can
get thoroughly acquainted with this art, not only in theory, but
also in practice. The practical application of what I am going to
say about evocation in this, my second volume will only become
possible for the reader who has attained the goal of my first book:
a thorough command of the mysteries of the first tarot-card, or at
least of the facts laid down in my first volume up to and including
Step 8. Only then will the reader be able to achieve. satisfying
results.
<br><br>If I succeed in paving the way for the reader who has worked
through my first book, so that he gets satisfying results in his
work, the aim of this book has been fulfilled. But even the reader
who intends to deal with this secret science only in theory will
find in this book an enlargement of his theoretical knowledge.
<br><br><i>The author</i>
<br><strong>THE HIGH PRIESTESS<A name=high></A>
<br>The Symbolism of the Second Tarot-Card</strong>
<br>The second tarot-card represents the temple of initiation, which is
identical to the microcosm, the small world. Often this card is
regarded as the temple of Salomon. The temple is supported by
four columns symbolising the four elements and denoting
knowledge, courage, will and silence, i. e. the quabbalistic Yod-He-Vau-He.
<br><br>Each column rests on a circular pedestal of hewn stone symbolising
the fact that the magician - after having been initiated in
this temple - has become absolute master of each element.
The black and white marble floor consists of proportionate
squares displaying the positive and the negative effects of the
elements in the physical world. In its higher sense this is the
lawfulness - the Jupiter sphere - on the physical plane, with
which the magician must be fully conversant before being initiated.
Before the altar the floor is covered with a carpet which -
divided into two equal halves - displays the positive and the
negative effects of all the powers of the planetary system on our
physical world. The magician must also be absolute ruler of these,
i. e. of the electric and the magnetic fluids.
<br><br>On the carpet one can see the magic circle representing Infinity,
i. e. the Alpha and the Omega (d. the description of the magic circle in the
relevant chapter of this book). The pentagram to be
seen within the circle is the symbol of the microcosm, the small
world, which must be fully developed in the magician, i. e. he is
in perfect harmony with the macrocosm. The pentagram is the
symbol of the microcosm, while the macrocosm usually being
symbolized by a hexagram.
<br><br>The magician, dressed in a violet magical garment, is holding in
his left hand the magic sword as the symbol of victory and of his
ties to the Almighty - of his intuition - attained by the Akasha principle;
his lifted right hand is conjuringly holding up the
magic wand, the symbol of his absolute will, his absolute power.
<br><br>On a golden throne to the right of the magician sits a high
priestess as the representative of Isis, holding the Book of Wisdom
in her left hand and the two Keys of Initiation in her right hand
as the symbols of the positive and the negative mastery. The
magician who has prepared himself for an evocation is being initiated
by her into the deep secrets of sphere magic. In some tarotcards
this priestess is called a female pope or an empress.
However, since this is the card representing power and wisdom,
it need not indicate the female principle.
<br><br>In front of the circle there are three steps leading to the altar.
They symbolize the mastery of the three planes - the physical,
the astral and the mental plane. The altar itself is the symbol of
devotion. The triangle placed in its centre demonstrates the threedimensional
effect of the Divine Emanation on everything, in the
Positive and the Negative principle.
<br><br>The two censers symbolize the fact that the magician carrying
out an evocation has all the positive, the good, and all the
negative, the bad, beings under his power and that he is able to
materialize them. The spheric mirror on the altar with its seven
spheric colours indicates symbolically that the magician is not only
in contact with all the beings of the seven planets by mental
wandering and divination, but that he is also capable of calling
them into our physical world by evocation.
<br><br>On the wall in the background, following the old-Egyptian
symbolism of the second tarot-card, are the pictures of the
Godesses Isis and Nephthys.

<br><strong><font size="5">PART I<A name=magic></A></font></strong>
<br><br><strong>MAGIC</strong>
<br>Magic is the highest science existing on our planet, for it teaches
the metaphysical as well as the metapsychic laws valid in all the
planes. This science has been called magic since human records
began, but it has so far been reserved to special circles, mainly
comprising high-priests and high potentates. They alone knew
the truth but kept it a secret. They not only were fully acquainted
with the synthesis of their own but of all other religions, too. The
people, on the other hand, were taught about religion in symbols
only. It took many centuries until scarce fragments of this science
were also made known to mankind in a veiled manner, as was
understandable. Because the majority of people had not undergone
any magic training by law, they could only understand these
fragments from their individual point of view and, in consequence,
pass on their knowledge incompletely and onesided. That
is the reason why magic science has, without any exaggeration, remained
a secret science up to this date. The true understanding of
magic laws depends on the spiritual maturity of the individual.
<br><br>To reach this maturity a certain pre-training is absolutely
necessary. The reader will therefore find it natural that he must
be fully conversant with the first tarot-card, at least up to Step 8,
if he wants to have further positive success in his practice of
higher magic.
<br><br>There are no miracles as such, furthermore there is also nothing
supernatural. The facts and effects remain obscure because people
are not able to perceive them first hand.
<br><br>Magic is a science teaching the practical application of the
lowest laws of nature up to the highest laws of the spirit. The person
intending to learn about magic must first learn to understand
the functioning of the lowest laws of nature in order to conceive
the laws building up on them and finally the highest laws. Depending
on the stage the reader has reached or on the laws he is at the
moment dealing with, he may, to get a better survey, separate
magical science in three groups; that is, in lower magical science,
which comprehends the laws of nature and their working, functioning
and controlling and may, if you please, be called natural
magical science. Furthermore, in the intermediate stage of magic
comprehending the operating and functioning and controlling of
the universal laws within man, that is the microcosm, the small
world; and finally in the high magical science comprehending the
operating, functioning and controlling of the laws of the
macrocosm, i. e. of the whole universe. I already mentioned a few
times in my first book the analogy by which lower, intermediate
and high magical science are connected and I also gave a full
description of the operation and functioning of these powers.
<br><br>Magical science may be compared with the school-system: low
magic is the subject of the elementary classes; intermediate magic,
that is the magic of man, is taught in secondary or grammarschool;
and high magic is lectured at the university. Since, according
to the Hermetic Tablet, the universal axiom valid for magic
is "as above - so below" and vice versa, it is strictly speaking, not
correct to talk about a low, intermediate and high magic. There
actually is only one unique magic, and the grade of maturity
which the magician in question has arrived at is the measurement
for his individual development. The universal laws, no matter
whether applied with good or bad intentions, always remain the
same. The application of a law depends on the character and the
intentions of the individual. If the magician uses his powers for
good purposes, he may choose, for himself, the expression "white
magic"; if he uses his faculties for bad purposes he may talk about
"black magic"; but no matter whether the actions of a magician
are morally good or bad, they are brought about by exactly the
same laws.
<br><br>The sensible reader will undoubtedly be certain that there exists
neither a white nor black magic. This differentiation has been
brought into common use by mystical and religious sects, since
they call a person they don't like a black magician. To give you a
striking comparison, just think of the fact that it would be equally
insensible from the universal point of view to say, for instance,
that night is evil and day is good. One cannot exist without the
other and both poles had to come into existence when the
macrocosm and the microcosm were created, in order to make
the one differ from the other.
<br><br>God, the creator of the universe, has not created anything
unclean or evil. This is not to say that man should do the good
and the evil. The difference between the two exist to enable man
to tell the truth from the opposite and to master it. The true
magician will therefore never underestimate the negative, but he
will also not avoid it. He will always allow the negative to take
the place due to it, and the negative must be as useful to him as
the positive. That is to say, the magician never considers negative
powers to be evil powers. He will look at good and evil not from
a religious, but from the universal point of view.
<br><br>Magic is usually mistaken for sorcery or witchcraft; I therefore
want to explain briefly the difference between magic and sorcery.
The true magician always adheres to the universal laws, he knows
about their causes and effects and deliberately uses these powers,
whereas a sorcerer uses powers the origin of which he does not
know, although he is fully aware of the consequences caused by
his using these powers; but he has no idea about their actual connections,
because he has no knowledge of the universal laws. He
might know one or two laws or have a partial knowledge of
them, but he does not see the true connections between the
operating, developing and functioning of these universal laws, as
he has not reached the maturity necessary.
<br><br>The true magician, on the other hand, unwilling to be graded as
a sorcerer, will never do anything without having full knowledge
about what he is doing. A sorcerer, too, may use this or that out
of his knowledge of magic with good or bad intentions, no matter
whether he uses positive or negative powers. But he has no right to
call himself a magician.
<br><br>A charlatan is a person trying to deceive other people. He is not
a sorcerer, nor is he a magician. He actually is, to use common
terms, a swindler. Charlatans like to boast about high magical
faculties, which, in truth, they do not possess, and try to surround
themselves with a veil of mystical secrecy in order to hide
their ignorance.
<br><br>It is this category of people who are responsible for the bad
name true magical science has got. The characteristics of a true
magician are not secrecy, nor external pomp quite the contrary.
He is modest and always trying to help people and to explain to
the mature persons the secrets of magic. Naturally, he will not
give away his secrets to people not yet mature enough for them,
in order to avoid degradation of the holy science. Never will the
true magician demonstrate his knowledge of magic science by his
external behaviour. A true magician is hardly any different from
an average citizen, for he always tries to adapt himself to any
other person, any situation or occasion. His magical authority is
an internal one with no necessity for external splendour.
<br><br>There is yet another inferior variation of magic to be mentioned,
for it is often mistaken for true magic, but has nothing to do
with the latter. I mean the so-called art of jugglery. The jugglers
manual skill and his faculty to cause illusionary impressions in
the people watching him enables him to copy some phenomena
which the genuine magician brings about by the application of
the universal laws. The fact that always jugglers use the word
magic for their tricks bears again evidence of the inferior meaning
to which it has sunk. It is not intended to give the reader any
details of jugglers tricks or stage tricks. It is, however, a fact that
the juggler is neither a sorcerer nor a magician, even though he
may give himself the most promising names because of his great
manual skill.
<br><br>In this book a synthesis will be given of that field of magical
science which up to our modern age has never been revealed: the
magic of evocation, since it is this field of magic which is most difficult
to understand. From the oldest age of antiquity up to our
modern times hundreds of books have been puplished which contain
instructions for the invocation of beings, for concluding
pacts with the devil, and so on. But none of those books has been
able to communicate to its readers genuine knowledge, nor to
secure for them success in the practical application of the
teaching, although it has sometimes happened that certain individuals,
due to their inherited disposition and their maturity,
have had success. The genuine magician who wants to get behind
the problems of the magical evocation need not fear that he will
only have a partial success, or no success at all. He will soon be
convinced that with the synthesis of the magic of evocation given
here he is able to carry out a successful evocation.
<br><br>The other categories of magic as, for example, the magic of
mummies, magic of sympathy, of spells by sympathetic means,
will not be dealt with in this book, for these fields will be easily
explored by the magician himself, should he be interested in
them. Instructions in this respect are to be found in the usual
books dealing with such matters.
<br><br><strong>The Magical Aids<A name=aids></A></strong>
<br><br>Though a genuine magician is able to carry out everything by his
own powers, which he has gained as a result of his spiritual
maturity during his development in the ways of magic, it remains
up to him to avail himself also of ceremonial magic and to make
use of it and of all its aids as much as he likes.
<br><br>The advantage ceremonial magic offers is that by repeated,
respectively constant use of one and the same instrument results
can be attained without the use of the magician's personal
strength. Ceremonial magic thus makes possible an easier working
with occult powers by the use of various aids. Actually all
auxiliary devices, all magical instruments, are aids to the
magician's consciousness and memory. By directing his attention
to a certain instrument, the faculties and powers it symbolizes are
brought to his consciousness. As soon as the magician - during
an act of evocation - takes into his hands one, or the other, of his
instruments, he will get the contact he wants and the results he is
aiming at without any special effort. If, for example, he takes his
magic wand in his hand, which represents his absolute will, the
contact with the desired spirit will be attained at once, due to
this wand, by means of the magician's will. The same will happen
in respect of all other magic aids, for they, too, symbolize
spiritual forces, laws and qualities.
<br><br>The magician who wants to make use of ceremonial magic must
be very particular about his magical instruments, for these are to
be treated with almost religious awe. Their value rises with their
careful, exact and attentive use. Magical instruments are the same
as holy relics and help the magician to create the necessary
temple-like atmosphere required for ceremonial magic. At the
moment of their application the magician must be almost in a
state of complete ecstasy. Should an instrument be used for any
purpose other than the one for which it is intended, it loses its
magical effectiveness and can no longer serve its original purpose.
<br><br>Since every magical instrument demands a special feeling of
respect in the magician's consciousness, it must be kept out of
those persons' sight who are not truly initiated, in order to avoid
its desecration. Before the magician reaches for his magical instrument
he must, therefore, undergo a mental cleansing process by
prayer or suitable meditation. He must never touch a magicial instrument,
unless he is in the necessary composure for the
ceremony. He must always be aware of the fact that every magical
aid or instrument symbolizes the most divine laws and that they
therefore must be handled like relics. Only in the hands of the
magician bearing all this in mind will the instruments bring about
the desired results.
<br><br>Taking all the measures recommended regarding his adjustment
to all magical instruments, the magician will bring about, in
himself, an extremely strong manifestation of faith, of will, and
all properties of the law, and thus increase his magical authority
that he will be able to influence a being or a force, by his will, to
bring about the results he is expecting.
<br><br>Even though the magician may not use his magical instruments
for a considerably long period of time, they still remain in constant
contact with the faculties they symbolize. As every instrument
is magically charged with (i. e. dedicated to) a special purpose,
it never loses its magical powers, provided it is handled correctly
- not even if centuries pass from the moment of its last application.
If the charging and consecration of the magical instruments is
such that they may only be used by a certain magician for whom
they have been manufactured, no other magician can make use of
them. They would not have any effectiveness even in the hands of
a magician who is fully initiated in the holy science of magic,
unless charged by the latter for his own purposes.
<br><br>In the chapters that follow the most important magical instruments
will be described together with their symbolic functions
as well as their practical application during ceremonial
magic operations. Using this information as a starting point,
every magician will be able to make further instruments to serve
special magical purposes, if necessary or desirable. I shall only
strive to give a guiding principle of how the magician has to proceed.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Circle<A name=circle></A></strong>
<br><br>All authors of books dealing with ceremonial magic and giving
reports about conjuration and invocation of beings of any kind
point out that the magic circle plays the most important role in
this. Hundreds of instructions can be found on how to make
magic circles to attain various goals, for instance with Albertus
Magnus, in the Clavicula Salomonis, in the Goethia, in Agrippa,
in Magia Naturalis, in the Faust-Magia-Naturalis and in the oldest
Grimoires. It is told everywhere that when invoking or calling a
being, one must stand within the magic circle. But an explanation
ofthe esoteric symbolism of the magic circle is hardly ever given.
Therefore I intend to give the studious and eager magician a completely
satisfactory description of the magic circle according the
Universal Laws and Analogies.
<br><br>A true magic circle represents the symbolic lay-out of the
macrocosm and the microcosm, that is, of the perfect man. It
stands for the Beginning and the Ending for the Alpha and the
Omega, as well as for Eternity, which has no beginning and no
end. The magic circle, therefore, is a symbolic diagram of the Infinite,
of Divinity in all its aspects, as can be comprehended by
the microcosm, i. e. by the true adept, the perfect magician. To
draw a magic circle means to symbolize the Divine in His perfection,
to get into contact with Him. This happens, above all, at the
moment the magician is standing in the centre of the magic circle,
for it is by this act that the contact with the Divinity is
demonstrated graphically. It is the magician's contact with the
macrocosm in his highest step of consciousness. Therefore, from
the point of view of true magic, it is quite logical that standing in
the centre of the magic circle is equivalent to being, in one's consciousness,
a unity with the Universal Divinity. From this one
can see clearly that a magic circle is not only a diagram for protection
from unwanted negative influences, but security and inviolability
are brought about by this conscious and spiritual contact
with the Highest. The magician who stands in the centre of
the magic circle is protected from any influence, no matter,
whether good or evil, for himself is, in fact, symbolizing the
Divine in the universe. Furthermore, by standing in the centre of
the magic circle, the magician also represents the Divinity in the
microcosm and controls and rules the beings of the universe in a
totalitarian manner.
<br><br>The esoteric essence of the magician's standing in the centre of
the magic circle is, therefore, quite different from that which the
books on evocations usually maintain. If a magician standing in
the centre of the magic circle were not conscious of the fact that
he is, at that moment, symbolizing God the Divine and Infinite,
he would not be able to practise any influence on any being whatsoever.
<br><br>The magician is, at that instant, a perfect magic authority
whom all powers and beings must absolutely obey. His will and
the orders he gives to beings or powers are equivalent to the will
and orders of the Infinite, the Divine, and must therefore be unconditionally
respected by the beings and powers the magician
has conjured up. If the magician, during such an operation, has
not the right attitude towards his doings, he degrades himself to a
sorcerer, a charlatan, who simply mimics and has no true contact
with the Highest. The magician's authority would, in such a case,
be rather doubtful. Moreover, he would be in danger of losing his
control over such beings and powers, or, what would even be
worse, he could be mocked by them, not to speak of other unwanted
and unforeseen surprises and accompanying phenomena
that he would be exposed, especially if negative forces were involved.
<br><br>The way in which a magic circle has to be formed depends on
the grade of maturity and the individual attitude of the magician.
The diagram, that is the drawing by which the Divinity is expressed
within the circle, is subject to the religious concepts of the
magician. The procedure followed by an oriental magician when
forming a magic circle is of no use to an occidental magician,
because his ideas of the Divine and the Infinite are quite different
from those of the magician from the East. If an occidental initiate
drew a magic circle according to oriental instructions, with all
divine names appertaining to it, it would be ineffective and completely
fall short of its purpose. A Christian magician must
therefore never draw a magic circle according to an Indian or any
other religion if he wants to save himself from an unnecessary effort.
<br><br>The construction of the magic circle depends, from the
beginning, on one's individual ideas and beliefs and one's individual
conception of the qualities of the Divine, who is to be
symbolized graphically by this circle. This is the reason why a
genuine magician will never draw a circle, carry out rituals, or
follow instructions concerning ceremonial magic to which he
himself is not identified in his individual practice. For this would
be similar to wearing oriental clothes in the occident.
<br><br>Bearing these facts in mind, it comes natural that the magic circle
has to be drawn in complete accordance with the views of life
and maturity of the magician. The initiate who is conscious about
the Harmony of the Universe and its exact hierarchy will, of
course, make use of his knowledge when drawing the magic circle.
Such a magician may, if he likes, and if the circumstances permit
it, draw into his magic circle diagrams representing the whole
hierarchy of the universe and thus come into contact with, and
awake his consciousness of, the universe much more rapidly. He
is free to draw, if necessary, several circles at a certain distance
from each other in order to use them for representing the hierarchy
of the universe in the form of divine names, genii, princes,
angels and other powers. One must, of course, meditate appropriately
and take the concept of the divine aspects in question
into consideration when drawing the circle. The true magician
must know that divine names are symbolic designations of divine
qualities and powers. It stands to reason that while drawing the
circle and entering the divine names the magician must also consider
the analogies corresponding to the power in question, such
as colour, number and direction, if he does not want to allow a
breach in his consciousness to come into existance because he has
not presented the universe in its complete analogy.
<br><br>Each magic circle, no matter whether a simple drawing or a
complicated one, will always serve its purpose, depending, of
course, on the magician's faculty to bring his individual consciousness
into full accordance with the universal, the cosmic consciousness.
Even a large barrel-hoop will do the job, providing the
magician is capable of finding the relevant state of mind and is
completely convinced that the circle in the centre of which he is
standing represents the universe, to which is to react, as a
representation of God.
<br><br>The magician will realize the more extensive his reading, the
greater his intellectual capacity and the larger his store of
knowledge happens to be, the more complicated his ritual and
magic circle will be in order to furnish sufficient support for his
spiritual consciousness, which then will make possible an easier
connection of the microcosm and the macrocosm in the centre of
the circle.
<br><br>As for the circles themselves, they may be drawn in various
ways to suit the circumstances, the prevailing situation, the purpose,
the possibilities, no matter whether they are simple ones or
whether they follow a complicated hierarchial system.
When working in the open air, a magic weapon, dagger or
sword has to be used for drawing the circle on the ground. When
working in a room, the circle may be drawn on the floor with a
piece of chalk. A large sheet of paper can also be used for the circle.
The most ideal circle, however, is the one sewn or embroidered
into a piece of cloth, flannel or silk, for such a circle can
be laid out in a room as well as outside of the house. The circles
drawn on paper have the disadvantage that the paper will soon
wear out and fall to pieces. In any case, the circle must be large
enough to enable the magician to move about in it freely. When
drawing the circle, the appropriate state of mind and full concentration
are most essential. If a circle were drawn without the
necessary concentration, a circle would undoubtedly be the
result, but it would not be a magic one. The magic circle that has
been worked into a piece of cloth or silk has to be re-drawn symbolically
with one's finger or magic wand, or with some other
magic weapon; not to forget the necessary concentration, meditation
and state of mind. The magician must, in such a case, be fully
aware of the fact that it is not the magical weapon in use that
draws the circle, but the divine faculties symbolized by that
magical instrument. Furthermore, he must realize that it is not he
that is drawing the magic circle at the moment of concentration,
but that the Divine Spirit is actually guiding his hand and instrument
to draw the circle. Therefore, before drawing the magic circle,
a conscious contact with the Almighty, with the Infinite, has
to be brought about by the help of meditation and identification.
<br><br>The trained magician, having a thorough command of the practical
exercises of the first tarot-card, as explained in my first work
"Initiation into Hermetics", has learned during one of the steps of
that book how to become fully conscious of the spirit and how to
act consciously as a spirit. It is not difficult for him to imagine
that not he, but the Divine Spirit in all its high aspects is actually
drawing the magic circle he wishes to have. The magician has thus
learned also that in the world of the Invisible it is not the same
although two persons might physically be doing the same, for a
sorcerer, who does not possess the necessary maturity, will never
be able to draw a true magic circle.
<br><br>The magician who is also acquainted with Quabbalah can draw
another snake-like circle within the inner circle and divide it into
72 fields, giving each of these fields the name of a genius. These
names of genii, together with their analogies, must be drawn
magically by pronouncing them correctly. If working with a circle
embroidered into a piece of cloth, the names inserted into the
various fields must either be in Latin or in Hebrew. I shall give
exact details about the genii and their analogies, use and effect in
my next work called "The Key to the True Quabbalah". An embroidered
circle has the advantage that it can easily be laid out and
folded together again without having to be drawn and charged
anew each time it is to be used. The snake presented in the centre
is not only the copy of an inner circle, but, above that, it is the
symbol of wisdom. Besides this, other meanings may be attributed
to this snake-symbol, for example the snake's strength,
the power of imagination, etc. It is not possible to give a full
description of all this, for this would go far beyond the aim of
this book.
<br><br>A Buddhist magician drawing his Mandala, putting his five
deities in the form of figures or diagrams on top of the relevant
emanation, is, at that moment, meditating about each single deity
whose influence he is trying to evoke. This magical ceremony,
too, is, in our opinion, equivalent to the drawing of a magic circle,
although it actually is a genuine prayer to the Buddhist
deities. To say more about this matter in this book is quite unnecessary
for enough material has already been published in
Eastern literature about this kind of magical practice, either in
exoteric or in secret manuscripts.
<br><br>A magic circle may serve many purposes. It may be used for
evocation of beings or as a protective means against invisible influences.
It need not in all cases be drawn or placed on the
ground. It can also be drawn in the air with a magical
weapon, like the magic sword or the magic wand, under the condition
that the magician is fully conscious of the universal quality
of protection, etc. If no magical weapon is at hand, the circle can
also be described with the finger or with the hand alone, providing
this is done in the right spirit, in agreement with God. It is
even possible to form a magic circle by one's mere imagination.
The effect of such a circle on the mental or astral plane, indirectly
also on this material world, depends, in this case, on the grade and
strenght of such an imagination. The binding force of the circle is
generally known in magnetic magic. Moreover, a magic circle
may be produced by the accumulation of elements or the condensation
of light. When practising evocations or invocation of beings,
it is desirable to draw within the centre of the circle in
which one is to stand another smaller circle or a pentagram with
one of its points upwards, the symbol representing man. This is
then the symbolization of the small world, of man as genuine
magician.
<br><br>The books dealing with the construction of the magic circle
clearly state that during the act of invocation the magician must
not leave the circle, which, in its magic sense, means nothing else
but that the consciousness of, or contact with, the Absolute, (i. e.
the macrocosm), must not be interrupted. Needless to say that
the magician, during his magic operation with the help of a magic
circle and with the being standing in front of him, must not step
out of the circle with his physical body, unless he has finished his
experiment and dismissed the relevant being.
<br><br>All this clearly shows that a true magic circle is really the best
means to practice ceremonial magic. The magician will always
find that the magic circle is, in every respect, the highest symbol
in his hand.
<br><br>It is hardly necessary to mention the specimen of a magic circle,
since every magician will now know from what I have said above
how he has to proceed, and it is now up to him to make use of the
instructions given here. Yet he must never forget the main thing,
that is the orientation he needs when working with a magic circle,
for only if he has reached the necessary cosmic contact by
means of meditation and imagination, i. e. the personal connection
with his God, will he be qualified for entering the circle and
starting work inside it.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Triangle<A name=triangle></A></strong>
<br><br>A magic triangle is, contrary to the magic circle, which symbolizes
infinity, endlessness, the connection with God, the Alpha
and the Omega, the symbol of manifestation, of everything that
is made, of everything that has ever been created. Without the
knowledge of the symbolism of the magic triangle and of all other
magic aids, ritual and ceremonial work would not be possible.
All grimoires or rites of exorcism generally require that the
magician who is working with a magic triangle sees that the invoked
spirit, the being and power, is manifested. The manifestation of a
being - a spirit - in a triangle is but one aspect of ritual
magic, and no being will be fully manifested unless the magician
understands the whole symbolism of the magic triangle. To get
the right idea of this symbolism one must, to some extent, be acquainted
with the Quabbalah and must have a complete knowledge
of the secret of the number three. The more one knows about the
analogy of the mystical number three, the deeper one will be able
to penetrate into the symbolism of the triangle one draws and the
easier it will be for a being to manifest itself.
<br><br>It would lead us too far if I were to deal fully, at this point, with
the mystical number three and its analogies. I can only give a few
hints which may serve the magician as guiding principles.
Above all, the triangle is a diagram of the three dimensional
world we know, i. e. the mental, the astral and the physical
world. Each power which is to be projected into the physical
world must run through the three planes mentioned above. The
diagram shows us that the triangle must be constructed with its
point upward and thus indicates that two powers project from a
point at the top to the right and the left and end in a line fixing
their limits. Taking the picture of these two diverging lines as a
whole, it shows the two universal powers, the Plus and the
Minus, electricity and magnetism, which are united by the line
below. By this the manifested causal world is symbolized, which,
from the astrological point of view, is equivalent to Saturn, i. e.
the mystical number three. In the mental world it symbolizes
will-power, intellect and feeling; in the astral world it symbolizes
power, legality und life; and in the physical world it symbolizes,
as already said above, the Plus and the Minus, and the Neutral.
The triangle with its conformity is thus reflected in everything
and on every plane, for it is the beginning of everything that has
been created, the cause of everything comprehensible. The
mystical number three, i. e. the symbolism of the triangle, plays,
as is well known, a very important role in every religion. In the
Christian religion, for example, there is the Trinity: God the
Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost; in Indian religion
there is Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, i. e. the creator, the preserver
and the destroyer, etc. Hundreds of symbolic analogies could be
given here, but it is left to the magician to go deeper into the
details of this symbolism and its analogies. The most important
thing for him to know is the equilateral triangle, which is, for the
magician, the universal symbol ranking immediately after the
magic circle.
<br><br>A magician would never be able to get a certain power or a certain
being into a circle without the help of the magic triangle, for
the circle is, as we now know, the symbol of the infinite and not
the symbol of manifestation. No magician should ever forget this
fact. One could, of course, also call a being or a power into a
figure different from the triangle, and this is usually done with
lower spirits, but when dealing with high powers or high ranking
beings the magician will never be able to work without having
drawn the relevant diagram, i. e. a triangle, immediately after having
constructed the magic circle. The magician will now be aware
of the fact that the circle is the first diagram having no limits; the
triangle is the first diagram with limits or space-symbol in which
a being, a power, etc. may be projected.
<br><br>In the case of magical evocation the triangle has to be large
enough to give sufficient space for the power or being evoked or
projected, for the being or power must never be bigger than the
triangle itself. The magician must make sure that the being
or power he has called into the triangle is under his full control,
and that he himself, while standing in the centre of the circle, is
thus representing a superior power, a universal, a divine idea.
Therefore, a being which has been called into a triangle is not able
to leave the triangle again without the magician's permission or,
to use a magical term, without "abdication". As for the shape of
the triangle, it may either be acute or right angled.
For the triangle the same material is used as for the circle.
<br><br>When operating in the open air, the triangle can be drawn with a
magical weapon such as the magic sword or dagger. If the circle
has been inscribed on a piece of cloth, then the triangle has to be
drawn on it also. The construction, of the triangle must be done
magically; not the physical hand of the magician is employed, it
must be drawn whilst the magician is fully conscious of his mental
and astral hand, similar to the construction of the magic circle.
Otherwise the triangle will produce no effects and will have no
influence on the power or being to be invoked. The magician has
to meditate, so that with the help of the triangle as the highest
symbol, the manifestation of the desired being or power is effected.
<br><br>The magician will soon realize that the more he knows
about the symbolism of the magical triangle, the greater will be
his influence on the being or power he has evoked. Furthermore,
it es a great advantage for the magician to know that already at
the point of drawing the triangle, he is, in his consciousness, connected
with God, which state he has brought about by having
meditated or used his imagination, so that actually not the magician
is drawing the triangle, but the deity incorporated in the
magician. It is quite useful to re-draw the line of an old triangle
with one of the magical weapons mentioned above each time
before using it again, in order to revive the analogies within the
triangle and also within the magician's mind. In case the triangle
is painted on a piece of cloth, the magician should gently follow
the lines with the weapon. In the case of magical operations for
which no magical weapons are needed the lines of the triangle
may be traced by a magic wand or with the forefinger alone.
The seal or the talisman of the being concerned is usually placed
into the centre of the triangle, in order to express its symbolic
meaning. I shall give a full description of how a seal or talisman
has to be made in one of the subsequent chapters. A well trained
magician can place a fluid condenser, relevantly charged, in the
centre of the triangle, instead of a seal, pouring it into a flat vessel,
into the so-called magic cup. But he can also use a piece of blotting
paper impregnated with the fluid condenser and relevantly
charged for the manifestation of the power or being to be called
up. It is, in principle, up to the magician's individual taste which
of the two described possibilities he makes use of. In some cases
these details may, however, depend on the choice of the powers
or beings which are to be evoked or manifested by the magician's
will.
<br><br>I have already dealt with fluid condensers, with liquid and solid
ones as well as with the simple and the complicated types, in my
first book "Initiation into Hermetics"; the magician may use
either simple or complicated fluid condensers, whichever serves
his purpose best.
<br><br>The magic triangle is, as can be seen from what has been said,
mainly a diagram for putting the magician into contact with the
power or being he wants to employ. It may serve a certain purpose,
or, if necessary, also more than one purpose. Its main object
is firstly to get into contact with the being or the power the magician
wants to employ, secondly to call a certain being from the
macrocosm into our physical world, and thirdly to condense this
being in a manner that it may even have certain effects on our
physical world. All this is directed by the magician's will. The being
or power evoked by the magician will either effect the mental,
or the astral, or the physical world, just as the magician wishes to
have it.
<br><br>Following the principles which by now are already well known
to the magician, each power or being will only have effects within
the spheres into which it has been called and in which it has been
condensed. This means that, for instance, a being projected into
the mental sphere will naturally not be able to influence the
physical world, but will only become effective in the mental
world. The same is valid for the astral and the physical world.
The reader will find more details about the mystery of condensation
or materialization from one sphere into the other in a later
chapter.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Censer<A name=censer></A></strong>
<br><br>Many people falsely think that the desired being or power must
appear when they are merely carrying out a censering or citation,
and they are very disappointed when they, in consequence, have
only partial success or no success at all. Sometimes they become
the victims of their own imagination or of various kinds of
hallucinations, which is even worse. I will reveal to the reader the
great mystery and the symbolic meaning of the magic censer.
<br><br>Above all, the symbolism of the censer conceals the mystery of
the materialization and condensation of the desired being or
power. Since this fact is known only to a few initiates, many
evocations in which the exteriorisation of a being is planned go
astray. As a good example of what is meant, let me compare such
faulty procedure with a fish that is pulled out of its element, out
of the water, under the supposition that it will go on living in the
air. Later on one is not a little surprised that the fish has quickly
perished. It is the same in respect of calling up beings and powers.
<br><br>If a being is to be called from an invisible world into this world,
then an atmosphere must be created which the being will find
agreeable. It would likewise be impossible for a human being to
enter, with his physical body, a more subtle atmosphere without
having taken the necessary measures before doing so. An appropriate
disposition along with strong will and faith might,
however, enable one to produce an oscillation in the own microcosm
which is agreeable to the being, and one might thus be
able to get into contact with the being, in a similar procedure
been described in "Initiation into Hermetics", i. e. in the chapter
dealing with the magic of the mirror. Nevertheless, the being
would, in such a case, never be able to transfer itself into our
physical world to have any effects on it. Only high intelligences
(spirit beings) acquainted with the laws of the physical world and
knowing how to apply these as a high initiate, who knows and
controls the laws of the spheres outside our physical world, are
able to prepare the place for manifestation - in our case the
triangle - by themselves. In a case like this, however, the magician
has no possibility to use and command the being which had
to produce the conditions for the projection by itself, not even
then if he would create the form of the deity within himself. He
would have to be satisfied with the fact that a being like that
would never acknowledge him as a true magical authority, but
would, on the contrary, try to deceive him deliberately, or would
refuse to obey him. This kind of evocation, in which a being
creates the necessary atmosphere by itself, is unfortunately practised
by sorcerers who, because of ignorance or incomplete
magical development, are incapable of preparing the so-called
magic space for the cited being.
<br><br>The being called up by a sorcerer in such a way will, in most
cases, refuse to obey, or will try to deceive the sorcerer, or even
force him to agree to a contract, a pact; not to mention the
menaces and the many other dangers that such a sorcerer would
have to face. The case of Dr. Faustus and Mephistopheles is a
striking example. I shall have a bit more to say about these two
later in this book. No doubt, there have been hundreds of cases
like that in the history of man; most of them, however, have remained
unknown. A genuine initiate taking all the measures and
considering all the applicable analogies for ritual magic will never
have to fear such a tragedy. It is therefore necessary for the magician
to know well the symbolism of all magical aids and to
understand them, in order to get complete control over beings
and powers.
<br><br>The censer serves, as I have said above, as the symbolism of the
materialization of a being. The magician is obliged to create the
atmosphere necessary for the being he intends to evoke, he must
not rely on the being to do that, for it would only create the atmosphere
to suit its own desire; otherwise the magician would be
in danger of completely coming under the influence of that being.
<br><br>According to the oldest available mysteries on the subject, the
creation of the atmosphere for a desired being of any rank was
understood as adjustment to the magical space. Various instructions
have been in use up to the present day. We are in possession
of old Egyptian papyrus rolls giving instructions on how to bring
about the necessary concentration on the magic space, but since
their symbols have been misinterpreted they have either dropped
out of use or been completely misunderstood.
<br><br>When preparing the space for the materialization of a being,
belonging to the symbolism of the censer, it is necessary that the
space first be impregnated. I have already dealt with the impregnation
of the space in the physical plane and with its charging
for one's own or for somebody else's use in "Initiation into
Hermetics", and have pointed out there how important this impregnation,
this concentration on the magic space in which the
desired being or power is to manifest itself, is when preparing the
censer. The quality of the impregnation of the space is dependent
on the type of power or being that is to be evoked. Surely,
nobody will charge the space with the principle of earth when, in
fact, he wants to work with the element of fire, etc. This would
not only be nonsensical, but it would also be in contradiction to
the law. If, for instance, the magician works with beings of the
elements, he must charge the space where he wants to have the beings,
materialized with the beings own elements. Gnomes and
other spirits of the earth can only appear in places filled, (i. e.
charged), with the elements of the earth, spirits of the water only
in places charged with the elements of the water, and spirits of the
air and fairies will only be manifested where the mental-astral
elements of the air are prevailing; salamanders or fire-spirits in a
space charged with the fire element; higher beings and intelligences
must have the space filled with light. This light must
have the colour of its planetary analogy. Extra-planetary beings
can only appear in a place filled with clean white light.
<br><br>The exact colouring of planetary light is effected by means of
imagination. Beings of the Saturn sphere will, for instance, only
appear to you, if you create a violet colour, the colour of Saturn.
Beings of the Jupiter planet will show themselves, if the colourvibration
is blue. The beings of the Sun appear in a golden colour,
those of the Mars planet in a red colour, those of the Venus in a
green, those of the Mercury sphere in an orange and those of the
Moon in a silvery colour. When working with positive beings the
colouring of the individual spheres in shiny light may only be a
very slight one. The darker the colour gets, the more difficult it
becomes for a good being to be manifested. When operating with
negative being the appropriate colour has to be deep and
saturated. If one tried to get a positive being to be manifested in
an impregnated space with a colour of dark vibration - even if it
were its appropriate colour - it could happen that a negative
being of the relevant planetary sphere would take on the shape of
the invoked positive being, trying to play the part of the desired
positive being. It is a rule that the being appears which has the
characteristics of the colour created. Lower beings need a darker
colour, i. e. a slower vibration, than higher beings, which, in fact,
have a cleaner colour und therefore a colour with a higher vibration.
<br><br>When working in the open air, a certain space has to be
designated by help of one's imagination; when operating in a closed
room it is essential that the whole room be charged with the
appropriate element. Impregnation is either effected by breathing
through the lungs or through the pores and making use of one's
imaginative powers or by the force of imagination alone. To create
the appropriate coloured light or element, the magician has to use
his body, which he will first load with the element or coloured
light and later empty it into the space via his hands and his magic
wand or directly through the pores, thus filling it up and enlivening
it - i. e. preparing it - for the being or power to be invoked.
<br><br>This practice of the imaginary transfer of coloured light from the
magician's body into the room is used for invoking beings and
powers which are to serve the magician's own purpose. However,
the same method is applied in case the magician intends to intensify
and project from his own body, soul and spirit - i. e. from his
microcosm - a quality or powers also belonging to a planetary
analogy.
<br><br>When working with beings which are to serve people other
than the magician, impregnation is only be effected by his imagination
alone; the space impregnation has then to be effected
directly from the universe. The desired power or being will only
be able to operate and intensify itself in a space prepared in this
way. If the space is sufficiently impregnated, the magician may
choose to create a special condensation in the magic triangle and
to form, by the help of his imagination, the shape of the being invoked.
The power of condensation, or dynamics, of the appropriate
element is, in so doing, of paramount importance, for
the effective manifestation of the being depends wholly upon it.
In order to facilitate this condensation, the magician may also apply
a weak incense, the ingrediences of which must, however, be
appropriate to the planetary sphere from which the being is
to be called.
<br><br>If the magician wants to have a specially strong influence for
physical effects, then the appropriate condensed electric or
magnetic fluid must be transfered into the shape created for the
appearance while burning incense. He may also banish one of
the two fluids, or, if he likes, both fluids - in this case called
electro-magnetic fluid - ("Initiation into Hermetics", chapter on
"volting") - into a fluid condenser, which, in consequence, will
be used by the being for becoming physically effective. If,
however, the magician intending to materialize a being does not
insist on its appearance in a special form and does not mind if the
being appears without any shape, or in a shape chosen by itsef,
then the surface of the liquid or solid fluid condenser placed
within the triangle has to be charged with the appropriate electromagnetic
volt whilst the magician is concentrating on the wish
that the being may use this power for effecting the desired results.
<br><br>The reader will find the necessary instructions for creating this
voltcharge in the shape of a ball with an electric inside and a
magnetic outside in "Initiation into Hermetics" in the chapter
dealing with "volting". There, too, all laws, for instance, the one
on the duration of an effect, etc., have to be considered. Physical
incensing with the necessary ingredients will only facilitate the
creation of the electromagnetic fluid. Possibly, the magician will
have to use it in the beginning if in need of something to support
his concentration on the matter. But it is not essential at all, and a
good magician, having all the laws perfectly under his control,
can certainly do without it.
<br><br>The use of narcotic ingredients, as suggested in many books on
exorcism will be avoided by a true magician, for such narcotics,
apart from their intoxicating effects, do not actually help to invoke
the desired being, but merely cause hallucinations or similar
projections in the sub-consciousness of the desired being. A genuine
magician will, therefore, never risk his health by such or
similar experiments.
<br><br>If the magician intends to have dead people or any other beings
living in the Akasha-world or the astral world appear in front of
him, or if he wants to use them for certain other purposes, then
he has to impregnate the space with the Akasha in the way described
above and he has to use the electro-magnetic fluid as a voltcharge
or to create one. I shall, however, return to this subject
and give a broader description of it in one of the next chapters
dealing with necromancy.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Mirror<A name=mirror></A></strong>
<br><br>The use of magic mirrors for purposes of ritual magic has, up to
now, been scarcely recommended in books on magic, since only a
very limited number of initiates have been acquainted with the
correct application of fluid condensers with regard to mirrors, and
these initiates have kept it a great secret.
<br><br>The magic mirror is a magical aid that is not absolutely
necessary, but the magician will always appreciate it as a good
support in his work, especially when operating with powers or
beings of minor intelligence. In some cases the magic mirror may
even replace the magic triangle. A magic mirror provided with a
fluid condenser is of great advantage, but if the magician has no
such condenser he will be able to do without; that is, an optical
magic mirror will suffice.
<br><br>I have given a full description of the use of the magic mirror in a
separate chapter of my first book "Initiation into Hermetics",
therefore I shall only say something about the purpose which a
magic mirror is to serve in connection with evocations and in
what way it may facilitate that work. In ritual magic it may be used
for the following purposes.
<br><br>1. To get into contact with powers and beings and to make
them visible. For this purpose, the magic mirror is either placed
into the triangle, or what is of even greater advantage, fixed to the
upper point of the triangle, on its outside. The charging or impregnation
of the mirror with the desired power comes next.
Employing your imagination you must concentrate your desire
for the thought purpose into the condensed power - volt -
before the actual evocation.
<br><br>2. The magic mirror may, secondly, be used for space impregnation
in which case the necessary dynamics will automatically be
preserved during the whole period of evocation without the
magician needing to pay particular attention to it, thus being able
to concentrate fully on the other phases of his ritual, for instance,
on the materialization or the clairvoyance. In such a case the mirror
is to be placed into a corner of the room, so that its influence
will work on the whole space of the relevant magic operation.
<br><br>3. The mirror may be employed as a magnetic force for attracting
the being that is to be evoked. To effect this, the surface of
the mirror must be charged with a fluid condenser facing the
direction in which it is to operate. The mirror has then to be placed
into the centre of the triangle or at the top of its upper point.
<br><br>4. Furthermore, the magic mirror may be used as an accumulator
or condenser - so that much qualitative and quantitative
power can be accumulated as to enable the being evoked
to bring about the desired effects. It does not matter if, in this
case, the being is to be transformed by the help of the condensed
power into a visible shape or if some other result or effect is intended.
All this actually depends on what the magician wishes or
desires to achieve.
<br><br>5. Moreover, the magic mirror may replace a telephone. For
this purpose the fluid condenser must be charged with the
Akasha and a timeless and spaceless state has to be created by
the force of concentration. The evocation then has to be spoken
into the mirror. The magic mirror thus becomes an astral channel
of communication. Not only is this the magician's method for
calling before him a certain being or power; the being itself is able
to talk to the magician out of the mirror. The magician may thus
sometimes hear the being's voice not only mentally or astrally,
but also physically, as if it were speaking through a loudspeaker.
In principle it will, however, be up to the magician to choose the
sphere in which the mirror is to operate. A mirror charged for
the physical world will make it possible for people not trained in
magic to hear the voice of a spirit. Of course, two magicians,
equally well-trained, may, if they choose, converse with each
other over the greatest distances, - not only astrally and mentally,
but also physically - by this mirrormethod, and they will hear,
if they like to do so, every word through their physical ears.
<br><br>6. There is still another purpose the mirror may serve in ritual
magic: for protection against undesired influences. The condensation
of light usually brings this about. When charging the mirror
the magician has to concentrate on his desire to keep off all
undesirable influences. The power of radiation of a mirror charged
in such a way must be great enough to prevent any larva, phantom,
etc., from coming near the space in which the magician is
operating; they must not, under any circumstances whatsoever,
penetrate into this space. Also in this case the mirror has to be
thus placed that it radiates the whole room or space in which the
relevant magic operation is carried through.
<br><br>In general, the magician will have his mirror serve only one
purpose. He will only apply it for that type of problem that
seems to him the most difficult one. In ceremonial magic, the
magician may, if he likes, use more than one magic mirror as a
magic aid, in order to attain his goals and facilitate his work.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Lamp<A name=lamp></A></strong>
<br><br>The magic lamp, known as the so-called laterna magica, is also
quite often referred to in many grimoires and in the oldest books
dealing with evocations. It represents, in the practice of ritual
magic, a very important aid, and the magician will surely want to
make use of it in his work. The magic lamp is the symbol of
enlightenment, cognition, experience, intuition and the inner
light; in short, all symbolic analogies of the light are represented
by the magic lamp. Lighting the magic lamp is, from the hermetic
point of view, equivalent to lighting the magician's inner light,
and having it burn like a flame. Colour, which comprises the
quality, vibration and oscillation of the light, is also one of the
mysteries of the magic lamp. The quality of a being or of a sphere
is expressed by the being's character. The purer and brighter the
coloured atmosphere of a being or sphere takes shape and the
more it shines and glistens the higher is its intelligence and the
purer is its quality. Low or negative beings appear in a dark and
cloudy, (that is, an unclean), colour.
<br><br>To know all this is of greatest importance to the magician practising
ritual magic. His enlightenment is symbolically expressed
by the lamp. When working with beings, the lamp has to be
covered with coloured glass or celophane paper in such a way that
the colour created will find the beings' approval. Thus, when
working with beings of the elements for the fire spirits the lamp
will have to have ruby-red glass or accordingly coloured that the
lamp radiates a red light. For spirits of the air or the so-called
faries, a darkblue light is necessary. The lamp therefore has to be
covered with dark-blue celophane paper or with a piece of silk of
that colour, thus creating a blue light. Water-spirits or so-called
waternymphs must have a green light. For spirits of the earth a
yellow colour which may have a shade of brown will have to be
used. The Akasha-colour can be used as a universal light, in which
case the lamp must have a violet colour. High spirits or intelligences
from the world beyond the planets need a white light.
<br><br>For beings coming from a certain planet the light has to be
created in such a way that it is appropriate to the colour of that
planet. Beings of Saturn, for example, thus need a light-violet or
ultramarine coloured light, beings from Jupiter a blue, from Mars
a red, from the Sun a yellow, from Venus a green, from Mercury
an opalescent and from the Moon a white light. Only in a very
restricted number of cases may operations of ritual magic be carried
out under normal artificial light, since physical electricity has
a disturbing effect on the astral oscillation which, at the time of
the operations, is vibrating in the room or place used for that purpose.
<br><br>Generally, the laterna magica or magic lamp is equipped
with a candle or oil-flame. An ideal light is procured by a spiritlamp,
a spirit-flame. The spirit (methyl) has to be prepared in a
special way: one third camomile blossoms to two thirds of spirit
are to me mixed together and to be left drawing in a closed bottle
or pot for 8 or 9 days, then the mixture is to be poured through a
strainer or otherwise filtered. The spirit prepared in such a way is,
at the same time, a useful fluid condenser, which, above that, may
be charged with the magician's will in order to get better results.
<br><br>The charged spirit, when set to flame, helps create a favourable atmosphere,
which will also contribute to bringing about good
results. The spirit-flame may also be charged for clairvoyance or
for different operations with the magic mirror, or for other astral
magic operations which need no artificiallight. If the magician is
operating in a closed room, the lamp may be placed in the magic
circle or into a corner of the room. It is most advantageous to fix
it in a position above the magician's head, so that the room is
evenly illuminated. When lighting the lamp, the magician has to
meditate and concentrate on the uniform kindling of the inner
light of soul and spirit.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Wand<A name=wand></A></strong>
<br><br>The most important aid in ritual magic is, and always will be, the
magic wand. Since the days of yore magicians and sorcerers have
been pictured with a magic wand. Charlatans and stage illusionists
are still making use of it today, trying to throw dust into
the eyes of their audience by all sorts of tricks. The person who
thinks it suffices to hold a magic wand in his hand in order to
fulfil wonders is led astray. I will give here an explanation of the
symbolic meaning and the description of the syntheses of the
magic wand, seen from the magical point of view theoretically as
well as for practical application.
<br><br>Above all, the magic wand is the symbol of the will, the power
and the strength by which the magician maintains his influence
on the sphere for which he has made and charged it. A magician
will not have just one wand for his practice, but he will make
several wands depending on what he intends to do or attain.
The actual purpose of a magic wand is to help the magician project
his will into any sphere or plane. He may have a wand <br><br>1. to
influence any being, no matter if human or animal, <br>2. to cure people
from diseases and to do away with bad, unfavourable influences,
<br>3. to evoke high intelligences and to invoke demons and
spirits.
<br><br>To say that the magic wand symbolizes the absolute
power of the magician is truly justified. The person having fully
comprehended the mystery of the magic wand in its magnitude
will never do his operations of ritual magic without this implement.
<br><br>It would lead too far, if I tried to state here all the
possibilities of the magic wand. For the intelligent student these
hints will suffice and will serve as guiding principles. His
knowledge will be enlarged by ample meditation.
<br><br>The magic wand is a condenser, no matter what material it is
made of or in which way it is manufactured. Charged with the
will of the magician, it expresses a certain power. It may be a simple
one (the usual type of wand) or a complicated one. All the
wands carved out of wood are regarded as simple wands. But only
a special kind of wood, suiting the purpose, may be used. Thus,
hazelnut or willow are to be used for a wishing-wand. The
wishing-wand is a modification of the magic wand. Though a
wand made of ash-wood may be used as a magic wand for all
magical operations the magician, when carrying out operations of
ritual magic, will only charge it for the purpose of curing people.
<br><br>The wand made of elder-wood, proves, on account of its analogy
to Saturn, especially efficient when calling up or evoking elemental
spirits and demons. In making magic wands willow twigs may
also be used for any type, for the willow is a very good fluid condenser.
The attentive reader will remember that willows are often
struck by lightning because of their high content of water, and
their capability of absorbing. He may also remember the old saying
referring to thunderstorms: "From the willow flee, look for a
beech-tree". The wood of an oak or an acacia, too, is an excellent
material for making a magic wand.
<br><br>It is, indeed, very easy to make a magic wand of any of the
kinds of wood mentioned. Cut a twig, approximately 3/8 to 3/4
ins. in diameter and about 12-20 ins. in length, remove its skin
and smooth it. Often the cutting of a magic wand has been
restricted to special astrological periods, and the magician acquainted
with astrology is free to make use of his knowledge
when making a wand. But such a procedure is by no means
necessary, since the magician knows very well that the stars may
have a certain influence, but that they cannot force the wise to do
anything, as he actually rules them. Thus anybody may, if he
likes, make by himself a magic wand out of one of the materials
mentioned above. If the magic wand is to serve ritual purposes,
you are recommended to use a new knife when cutting the twig.
The knife may later be used for other ritual purposes or other
magical operations. It should, in that case, never be employed for
any common purpose. If the magician does not expect to use the
knife again after having cut and smoothed the twig for the magic
wand, he should bury it in order to prevent it from ever coming
into the hands of anyone else.
<br><br>Another kind of magic wand is the steel magnet which has to
be equipped with an insulated grip. Take a round steel rod (the
best steel to use is electro-steel, (i. e. magnet steel) approximately
12-20 ins. long with a diameter of 3/8 ins., polish it and have it
nickel-plated to prevent it from rusting. After having nickelplated
the rod, the magician may magnetize it by means of an
electric coil, similar to the magnetization of a horse-shoe or the
magnet of an electrical motor. The greater the power of attraction
of the magnet, the better it works. This is the way to get a very
strong steel magnet which will not only do its work as such, but
which will also serve as an excellent magic wand for many
magical and magnetic experiments. First of all one must locate the
north and the south pole on the magic electro magnetic rod and
mark both poles: the south-pole with a minus and the north-pole
with a plus. For the insulation of the rod the middle must be then
wound with a silk ribbon as wide as the palm, i. e. about 3-4 ins.
A rubber hose of the same length or a wooden handle that has
been pierced for this purpose may also be used. Such a wand will
enable the magician to cause many magnetic and magical
phenomena, of which only a few will be treated here.
<br><br>If the magician is working with the electromagnetic fluid of the
universe, intending to intensify it strongly in the physical world,
then he must take hold of the wand in such a manner that his
right hand will touch the plus-pole and his left hand the minuspole,
with the ends of the rod touching the middle of his palms.
<br><br>After this the electrical fluid from the universe has to be led via
the right side of the rod into the magician's body by means of the
imagination. The plus-radiation of the rod (odpole-radiation) will
thus be strongly intensified as it has the same oscillation and will
make it easier for the magician to store the electrical fluid in his
body. The same procedure has to be applied to the magnetic fluid
of the south-pole. Vice versa the magician now intensifies the
electrical fluid again, which he has previously stored up in his
body, this time concentrating it into the plus-end of the rod so
strongly that he can make his influence work directly on the
physical world. The same goes for the magnetic fluid which he
will be able to store up in his left, that is the negative pole radiation.
The middle of the rod, covered with the insulating material,
will remain neutral. If the magician, by force of imagination, now
concentrates his intention into the condensed electromagnetic
fluid of the steel magnet the wand indeed becomes a magic wand.
<br><br>By means of the electromagnetic fluid, which radiates as a
brilliant light from the rod, any realization on the physical world
will be possible. Initiates usually apply this wand for influencing
sick people and for all magnetic phenomena. This magic electromagnetic
wand is, by the Law of the Universe, an excellent condenser
with the same kind of oscillation as the universe, but in a
most subtle way. The person meditating on this will be able to
find other methods easily due to the universal laws. The magician
will, for instance, be able to either pull the fluid out of the
universe like an antenna and store it in his body, or to transfer it
by force of imagination to other people, near him or far away.
The wand will soon be an indispensible implement for the magician,
for the positive and negative powers concentrated in it will
help him to create the necessary oscillation in his electromagnetic
fluid.
<br><br>Besides this, there are magic wands charged either with solid liquid,
or combined condensers. Much could be said about how to
make such rods and which methods are to be used, but I will only
mention the most appropriate to serve the magician in his work.
<br><br>Take the twig of an elder-bush, 12-20 ins. long and 3/8 to 3/4
ins. in diameter, peel off its skin and smooth it with sand-paper.
Then remove its pith so that you get an elder-pipe. Put a cork on
the one end of the pipe and seal it with sealing-wax, insert a condenser
(a liquid condenser, if you like) from the other side, then
also seal this end of the pipe airproof. The rod is now ready for
use. You may, if you wish, use a different kind of wood, for instance,
the twig of an ash, willow or oak tree, or of a hazelnut
bush. The twig, which has no pith must, however, be pierced
through carefully with a fine drill, making a pipe of it. Instead of
the liquid condenser a solid condenser may be used, the same
kind of condenser described in "Initiation into Hermetics". It is
also possible to use a piece of blotting paper soaked with a liquid
condenser instead of a solid condenser, which, after it has dried
well, is charged, and then, after having been rolled together, is inserted
into the hollow space of the rod. The disadvantage of wood
is that it will, as time goes by, moulder or be affected by the fluid
condenser, which will cause it to become perforated. It might
therefore as well be replaced by a metal-pipe. Those kinds of
metals which are good conductors of heat and electricity are best.
<br><br>The best of all, of course, is a copper pipe with a diameter of 3/8
to 1/2 inch. In order to avoid any oxidization on the surface of
the metal, the pipe can be nickel, chrome, or tin-plated before it is
filled with the condenser. One opening must be soldered together
at once, the other immediately after having filled up the pipe;
thus you get a first class magic wand, applicable for all purposes.
Magicians working with the magnetic and the electric fluid in
turn will do well to procure for themselves a rod made out of a
thin iron or steel pipe, as recommended above, for operations
with the magnetic fluid, and a copper-pipe for operations with
the electric fluid. A universal wand is manufactured in the same
manner, with the exception that a nickel-plated brass pipe must
be used, instead of a pipe of copper or iron.
<br><br>The magician wealthy enough for financial considerations not
to matter can use, instead of the fluid condenser, a condenser
made of semi-precious stones. He will use for his electric fluid, a
copper-rod the inside of which is filled with pulverized amber, an
unsurpassed condenser for this kind of fluid. For his operations
with the magnetic fluid he will, in this case, have to fill up the
steel-pipe with pulverized rock-crystal instead of using a solid
condenser. Rock-crystal, again, is a very good fluid condenser for
the magnetic fluid. But it is also possible to solder two separate
small pipes, thus making a single rod out of them; one half of the
tube is, in this case, filled up with pulverized amber, the other
with pulverized rock-crystal. Having done this, a single rod,
separated in the middle, will contain both kinds of fluid condensers.
In a case like this, however, the two halves must be connected
by a thin piece of copper - or iron - wire going through
the centre of both pipes. The outside of such a rod may be nickel-
plated. This ideal wand then has a unique fluid capacity and will
serve any magical operation.
<br><br>There is still another possibility: a wooden rod may by ornamented
with seven rings made of the planetary metals. The
rings should be fixed to the rod in quabbalistic order. That is, a
golden ring (for the Sun) is placed in the middle of the rod and
three metal rings on each side. The following metals may be used
for the rings in question:
<br><br>Lead corresponding to Saturn
<br>Tin corresponding to Jupiter
<br>Iron corresponding to Mars
<br>Gold corresponding to the Sun
<br>Copper corresponding to Venus
<br>Brass corresponding to Mercury
<br>Silver corresponding to the Moon
<br><br>Apart from this, the rings may have engravings portraying the
intelligences of the above-mentioned planets. The use of a wand
like this will, in general, be restricted to the conjuration of intelligences
of the seven planets. When used for other purposes, it
will not prove superior to the other types of wands.
<br><br>This is all the magician needs to know: from the examples
above he will, by himself, be able to proceed to other variations.
The shape and the size of the wand plays a minor part. The most
important thing about a magic wand is its charging for practical
use, a description of which is given below.
<br><br>The charge of a magic wand is done in much the same way as
the charge of a magic mirror provided with a fluid condenser
for special purposes. There are many ways of charge for a wand.
They all depend on what the magician intends or wants to use it
for.
<br><br>Above all, the magician must always be aware of the fact that
the magic wand is a symbol of his will, his strength and his
power, and that it is representing a container like a fluid condenser
of that power, quality etc. in which he is not only able to
transfer, but also to store up that power, according to his wish, to
an exeedingly high density. It matters little if such a rod is
nothing but a simple twig, cut and adapted accordingly, or if it is
a complicated wand, saturated or filled up with a fluid condenser.
<br><br>A magic wand may be charged with:
<br><br>1. the magician's will-power
<br>2. special qualities, faculties, etc.
<br>3. magnetism, biomagnetism, etc.
<br>4. the elements
<br>5. Akasha
<br>6. the help of a light-fluid
<br><br>Here are some examples for practical use:
<br><br>With regards to Point 1, charge with will-power:
Take into your hand the wand which you have prepared and
concentrate your will on, or rather into, the wand; that is,
transfer your whole consciousness into the wand so that you feel
you are the wand itself. Your concentration must then be filled
with the idea that all your will-power, your strength, is embodied
in the wand. This kind of concentration must last for at least five
minutes without any interruption. Already at the moment of embodying
your will into the wand you have to think that whenever
you take the wand into your hand your will-power will be put into
action and that everything you want to have happening will
happen. When you have transferred your whole will by utmost
tension and strongest imagination into the wand, you end the
charge of it by wrapping it into a piece of pure silk and putting
it in the same place as your other magic implements.
<br><br>After some time load the wand again in the same manner, and
every time you repeat the cerem.ony you must increase the intensity
of your imagination. Never forget that your whole spiritual
will is embodied in the wand. It is important that you limit the
time and if possible, also the space of the power concentrated in
the wand; that is, concentrate your willpower into the wand with
the idea that as long as it will exist it will represent all your will,
all your power, and remain effective. A wand charged in this way
will remain effective till you die, or should it be your special
wish, even beyond your physical death, that is, it will remain a
magic wand. It may even last for centuries, and its influence may
even increase with time, providing you have charged it with the
wish that its power should grow from one day to the next. The effectiveness
of the wand will first work on the mental sphere,
then, after some time and repeated charging, on the astral sphere,
and finally even on the physical world. The time required until a
wand, first effective on the mental world, becomes effective in the
physical world depends on the magician's maturity, training and
power of imagination, and also on what he is striving for. The
magician who is well acquainted with quabbalah will know that
to bring about a realization from the mental sphere into the
physical world, usually about 462 repetitions are necessary; by
then the influence from the mental sphere takes shape, that is
becomes condensed in the physical world. This, however, does
not mean that the magician may not be able to bring about the
same kind of success earlier than this. As already pointed out, the
magic wand's power of realisation depends on the intention and
purpose for which it has been made and charged. One could
query whether the rod needs to be charged at all, since the magician's
will should suffice. The magician, however, will not always
be in a position to expand his mental exertion in the manner
necessary for the transfer of one's will. There will be situations
which will exhaust even the best magician, who then would be incapable
of concentrating to his fullest power of expansion.
<br><br>However, a skillfully charged magic wand will also have its effect
at moments when the magician is not using his will-power, but is
just concentrating his thoughts on the realization of his wish, using
his magic wand for this purpose. There is, of course, in this
case a slight danger that a blasphemous person may get hold of
the magic wand in order to realize his own desires, which, if it
happened, would go on the cost of the magician and his rodvoltage.
<br><br>Therefore a magician will always do well not to tell any
person, not even his best friend, for which purpose, in which
respect, and in which manner he has charged his magic wand.
This way of charging a magic wand with one's will-power will
generally serve to influence beings, spirits, human beings and
animals which are to act according to the magician's absolute will
and which are to obey the magician's magical power, no matter
whether in this physical world or on the mental or astral planes.
<br><br>The influence of the magician is not at all restricted to living entities;
it will also work on dead matter if this has been taken into
consideration at the time of its being charged.
<br><br>Regarding Point 2: charge with qualities, faculties and the like:
Under charging the wand with certain universal qualities is
understood qualities such as omnipotence or other specific ones
which the magician needs for his realizations in the mental, astral
or physical planes and which are concentrated into the rod in the
same manner as described above. It is possible (similar to the
charge with the magician's will) when charging the wand with
a certain quality, to impel the quality into the wand not only by
embodying one's consciousness into it and by condensing the
power, but also by pulling the quality down from the universe by
means of one's imagination and concentration of will-power,
thereby condensing the quality in the wand, thus charging it.
Constant condensing of a certain quality will make the relevant
spiritual power if concentrated in the wand a direct physical
power. This means that with the wand the magician is in possession
of an accumulator equivalent to a battery powerfully charged
with electricity. That then one and the same power may be used
for good as well as for bad purposes is true, but a magician, having
proceeded as far as this in his individual training, will never think
of any evil motives or try to put them into action, since he, at all
times, is anxious to be regarded as a true and faithful servant by
Divine Providence.
<br><br>Regarding Point 3: charge of the wand with Magnetism,
Biomagnetism or Prana:
The same procedure is to be followed as described in the
preceding chapter. It is recommended, however, to achieve the
storing of power in the wand without transferring one's consciousness
into it. This can be effected by mere imagination, by
means of the magician's body or directly from the universe. In
this case, too, the magician must not forget to set limits to the
power transformed into the wand. He must also, by force of imagination,
concentrate on the purpose he wishes the wand to
serve. Repeated charge of the wand will make it not only effective
in the mental and astral planes, but also in the physical world.
The experienced magician need not be told again that the power
then dwelling in the wand will radiate to the furthest distances. If
he introduces the Akasha-principle between himself and his object,
he will be able to bridge time and space, and the power in
question will immediately, by using the wand, work on the person
concerned with the same kind of influence, intensity and success
as it would be if the person were standing right in front of
him. Charged with life-force or magnetism, with the right idea of
setting limits or conditions (that is, in this case, with the idea that
the life-force or magnetism in the wand will be automatically intensified
from one day to the other) the wand will easily enable
the magician to call into existence any phenomena that can be effected
by life-force. With a rod charged in this way, even an unexperienced
person could work miracles, providing he knew how
to use it. Therefore it is in the magician's own interest to keep
well the secret of his magic wand. He may also charge his wand in
a manner that it will automatically, without any effort on part of
the will-power of the magician, bring to him a piece of life-force
from the universe, which will then radiate from the wand. This
kind of charging the wand with magnetism - biomagnetism - is
preferred for curative operations. A magician working in the
medical field may like to make use of this method and heal people
far away from him by force of his wand charged in the above
mentioned manner. In the hands of a magician, a wand charged in
this manner, which can heal people miraculously over the widest
distances, is, no doubt, a blessing for the suffering man.
<br><br>The charge of a magic wand with an electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic
fluid is always the same, with the only exception that
the transfer of the magician's consciousness may be omitted. If
only one wand is to be charged, the procedure is a little more
complicated. For the wand to be charged with one fluid only, be
it electric or magnetic, that fluid has to be drawn from the
universe with the help of the imagination und must be impelled
into the rod, to which end the magician has to concentrate on the
wish that whenever he desires something, the fluid inside the rod
will realize at once what he wishes, even though it be directed to
the furthest possible sphere or the Akasha-principle. If you terminate
the accumulation so that the fluid accumulated in the rod
will intensify itself automatically from the universe, that it will,
in other words, work by itself bioelectrically and biomagnetically,
the rod will grow into an enormously strong battery. The
magician is recommended to accumulate in his own body, prior to
every use, the revelant fluid in order to be strong enough for the
work with the accumulated fluid of the wand. If he is not willing
to do this, he should at least insulate himself before he starts work
by putting on a pair of pure silk-gloves, preferably manufactured
by himself. Not before he has thus insulated himself should he
take the wand into his hands. Since the magician usually works
with both fluids, he should take the wand charged with the electrical
fluid into his right hand, and the wand charged with the
magnetic fluid into his left. It is always better to charge two rods;
one with the electric the other with the magnetic fluid, especially
if simple twigs or wooden wands, which are not impregnated
with a fluid condenser, are used. This is not absolutely necessary,
but it will make work easier. The magician who has a wand filled
with a fluid condenser, without the wand being parted in the middle,
will find it more advantagious to have the wand filled with
only one fluid, as this also will make the work easier for him. If
the rod is to be charged electromagnetically, that is if both fluids
should be prevalent in the wand, the magician must use a rod
which has no hole in its middle. Either end of the rod has to be
pierced instead, and each half of it has to be provided with a fluid
condenser. The magician must, however, put a mark on either
end to remind him where the electrical and where the magnetic
fluid is. To give the magician a better view, the half provided for
the electrical fluid is usually painted red, the half provided for the
magnetic fluid is usually painted blue. The rod must then be
charged in such a manner that the largest intensity of the fluids
rest at the ends of the rod and that the middle, insulated with silk,
remains neutral. Charging of either half has to be carried out
separately, that means that you may draw from the universe first
the electric fluid, accumulating it in the one end of the rod until
that end is sufficiently loaded, and immediately after that the
magnetic fluid, or vice versa. The magician should never try to accumulate
the electric fluid several times and then the magnetic
fluid several times; for the equilibrium of the fluids inside the
wand must be maintained. The magician must therefore accumulate
the electrical fluid on one day and the magnetic fluid
the next day. When charging the wand again, he has to go about
in the other way.
<br><br>The magician will charge a rod with the electrical or the
magnetic, or both fluids, if he wants to make his influence work
by the help of these fluids on objects nearby or far away,
regardless of their being subject to the Akasha or existent in
either the mental, astral or physical world. Special variations of
operations, for instance such as volting or treating sick people, or
bearing of certain imaginations, will not be dealt with here, for
the person having carefully studied up to this point will now be
able to work out for himself his individual working methods.
<br><br>Regarding Point 4: the charge with elements:
This kind of charge can be effected in two different ways:
<br><br>1. The magician, by help of imagination charges his rod - no
matter, whether it be simple or provided with a fluid condenser
- with desire that when using it, the elements will have to obey
him, regardless of which sphere they may belong to. If the wand
has been sufficiently charged with the magician's power over the
elements, then the results wanted will be brought about by the
beings of the elements. The magician will do well to expand his
power to all elements, fire, air, water and earth, so that he will
not be forced to restrict his operations to a single element. When
evoking, the magician should call to his magic circle the heads of
the elements, one after the other, and have them swear to the
magic wand that they will give him their absolute obedience at all
times. After that the magician may, if he likes, engrave on his
wand the relevant symbols or seals of each individual head of the
elements. This, however, is by no means absolutely necessary, for
the wand in the hands of the magician represents the magician's
absolute will and his power over each being of the elements. The
shape of the seals of each head of the elements will become visible
to the magician in his magic mirror or by direct transfer with the
mental body in the realm of the elements. On top of that, the
magician might well, on account of his personal experience and
development, construct a symbol of the relevant element and
have the head of any element swear to it that he will always be the
obedient servant not only of the symbol which the magician has
engraved in the wand, but of the whole wand.
<br><br>2. The other way to charge the wand with elements is as
follows: The magician draws the element which he wants to use
for his work directly from the universe, that is, its particular
Iphere, by force of the imagination, and dynamically accumulates
it in the wand. When working with this kind of loaded wand, the
results wanted are not caused by the beings of the elements, but
directly by the magician himself. The advantage of this way of
charging a wand is that it will give the magician a strong feeling of
latisfaction, because he is the immediate cause of the magical effect.
<br><br>It is necessary, however, that a separate rod be manufactured
for each of the elements and the wands must be stored apart from
each other. To prevent the magician from mixing them up, he
must be sure that he can easily differentiate between them by
their outside appearance. Each wand may, for this purpose, have
the colour of the relevant element. At the beginning the results
will only occur on the mental plane, but prolonged use and
repeated charging will make it work also on the astral plane, and
eventually also on the physical world. This kind of wand will
enable its owner to influence all manners of spirits, men, animals,
even inanimate nature, by the element, similar to the influence of
the electromagnetic fluid. Good magicians are able to cause, by
the force of such a wand, marvelous natural phenomena, for instance,
change of weather, acceleration of the growth of plants,
and many other things of that nature.
<br><br>Regarding Point 5: Charge with the Akasha-principle:
When applying this principle, the charge of the magic wand is
possible, but not any kind of accumulation, since the Akashaprinciple
cannot be intensified. But repeated meditation on the
qualities of the Akasha-principle with all its aspects in the magic
wand will finally enable the magician to create causes in the
Akasha-principle, which will itself realize in the mental and astral
planes, and also in the physical plane. Using a rod charged in the
manner described, the magician will be able to impel, by force of
imagination, a power or quality via the wand into the Akasha,
which then, like a volt created by an electromagnetic fluid, will
have direct influence on the three-dimensional world from above.
Such a wand will be regarded with awe by positive intelligences
and will have a frightening effect on negative beings. A wand
charged in this fashion is usually preferred by magicians working
with negative beings, so-called demons, in order to make them
pliant. For further details on this subject see the chapter dealing
with necromancy.
<br><br>Regarding Point 6: Charge with Light-Fluid:
The universal light, from which everything has been created, is
to be accumulated in the wand by help of imagination and consideration
of the qualities of the light, so that it will shine like a
sun (concentrated universal light). A wand charged in this way is
usually employed for theurgical purposes, that is for the evocation
of higher beings of the light and intelligences, for it is an excellent
magnet which will make the relevant light beings pay attention
to the magician's will and desire. Besides this, all other
measures must be taken, like, for instance, the insulation of the
rod with white silk, its secure keeping and so on.
<br><br>Not only will the magician be able to work, with the help of
the wand, in the physical world; he will also be in position to
transfer, with his mental or astral hand, or with both, the mental
and astral sphape of the wand into the relevant plane and will
have his influence work in these planes without having to hold
the wand in his physical hand. In case of the exteriorisation of his
whole mental body, he can take with him not only the mental
shape of his magic wand with all its qualities into the mental
plane but also the mental shape of all magic implements and
aids, and there he is able to operate as if he were present with his
whole physical body to carry out the operations. Never should
the magician forget that the wand represents his true will in its
completeness, absoluteness and power, which may well be compared
with a magical oath, and therefore many magicians have
their magic wand symbolize not only their will-power, but also
the magical oath, which, from the hermetic point of view, may
never and can never be broken. Many magicians carve into their
wand the symbols appropriate to their will-power and the charge
of the wand. Universal symbols, signs, seals of intelligences,
divine names, and the like, may serve this purpose as far as they
represent the true will-power of the magician. The details of this
particular matter are left entirely to the magician's individuality.
The magician will know from these instructions how he has to go
about reaching his aim, and it is up to him to provide, if he likes,
his wand with a secret name standing for his will-power. It will
also be clear to the practising magician that such a name must be
kept a secret and must never, under any circumstance, be
spoken.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Sword, Dagger and Trident<A name=sword></A></strong>
<br><br>There are evocations of negative beings and such not liking being
transferred into our physical world. For these beings the magician
will use, should the magic wand not suffice, the magic sword, providing
he insists on their manifestation. The magic sword has
several symbolic meanings, but generally it serves as the symbol
of absolute obedience of a being or a power to the magician. It is
also the symbol of victory and superiority over any power or being.
<br><br>The sword is analogous to the light, it is an aspect of the fire
and of the word. Already the bible says: "In the beginning was
the word - light - and the word was with God". He who is
somewhat acquainted with symbolism will remember that, as an
example, Archangel Michael, the killer of the dragon, is symbolized
with a burning sword; the dragon, in this case, is the symbol
of the hostile, the negative principle. Adam and Eve, too,
were driven out of paradise by an angel with a burning sword.
The symbolic meaning is also in this case quite clear and unequivocal.
<br><br>The magic sword usually serves as an implement in those cases
where the magician wishes to exert a certain compulsory or
forceable influence on a power or being, usually quite against its
will. It is an indispensable implement for magicians dealing exclusively
with demonology and who therefore would never get
any positive results unless they were using a magic sword. The
true magician will usually get satisfactory results with his magic
wand, but in spite of this he will not fail to manufacture for
himself an implement such as the magic sword, in order to have
it handy in case of emergencies. Such a magic sword means more
safety for the magician and will strengthen his authority. But
when working, he will only use the sword for operations,
especially for evocations, if a being were to oppose him strongly
or to refuse to obey him.
<br><br>Some grimoires call such an instrument as the sword a dagger,
yet the magic dagger is nothing else but a diminished sword with
the same kind of symbolism. A magic dagger is manufactured the
same way as a magic sword.
<br><br>When evoking demons and lower spirits, the sword or dagger
may be replaced by a trident which has to be mounted on a long
wooden shaft, similar to a wooden fork. The trident, like the
sword or dagger, is a means of coercion. Grimoires, on top of
that, recommend ornamenting the trident with engravings of
divine names. This is left to the magician's individual taste and
depends on the purpose of the evocation and the magician's attitude.
<br><br>The trident is also an enlarged symbol of the magic sword:
the three points symbolize our three-dimensional world, and the
magician can force the beings to fulfill his desire not only in the
mental or astral world, but also in this physical world, or, if the
magician likes, in all three planes. Regarding this, the fact that
demons usually turn up with a trident and are pictured with a trident,
should be mentioned. This does not mean that they run this
trident through the souls in hell, as is sometimes wrongly assumed
by foolish people, but that their influence works on all three
worlds: the mental, astral and physical.
<br><br>The points of magic swords, daggers or tridents may also be
employed for breaking or killing unevoked and unwanted beings
like phantoms, larvae, elementals, elementaries, and the like,
which may try to hinder the magician in his work. And yet
another way of using these implements must be mentioned here
since it is hardly known to anybody: a magic sword or dagger,
not so much a trident, may do good service as a magical lightningconductor.
<br><br>After having ended his evocations, especially after evocations of
higher negative beings, principals of demons and the like, the
magician who intends to go to rest but who is uncertain whether
these spirits will let him sleep unmolested, may furnish his bed
with a magic lightning-conductor. Such a lightning-conductor can
be manufactured by winding a copper or iron wire round the legs
of the bed, both ends of which have to be connected with the
sword or dagger. Then the sword or dagger must be stuck into
the floor. The wires form a closed circle around the bed even if it
has a square shape. The function of the sword or dagger is to conduct
the influence directed towards the magician into the earth.
<br><br>Of course, the wire has to be drawn with the wish in the magician's
mind, that it will form a circle and that no being or any unfavourable
influence will be able to get inside the bed and that
every influence, no matter from which being it may come, will be
conducted into the earth. In such a magically sheltered bed provided
with a magic lightning-conductor the magician will sleep
undisturbed, and he may rest assured that no influence, no matter
from which sphere it may come, will never have any effect upon
him, or will ever be able to surprise and overwhelm him. If the
magician has no sword or dagger handy at the moment, or if he
has to use it for other purposes, a new knife which, in this case,
must not be used for any other purposes, will fulfill the same
function. This magic lightning conductor will also protect the
magician against influences of black magic, especially during the
hours of sleep. A well-trained, fully developed magician may be
able to do without this implement, for he may draw a magic circle
around his bed by force of imagination, mentally or astrally,
thereby using his wand, sword or dagger. This will also give him
full protection against any unwanted influences.
<br><br>The way in which a magic sword is manufactured depends on
the magician's individuality. Several books instruct the magician
to use a sword which has formerly been used for cutting off a
man's head. This is obviously suggested to raise, in the heart of
the magician, a certain feeling of awe, or a certain stress as soon as
he takes hold of the sword. Usually those magicians who make
use of such a sword are those who need such superficialities to get
into the right state of mind. From the hermetic point of view
such or similar pre-conditions are not necessary, providing that
all other faculties necessarily exist. A sword made of the best kind
of steel (refined steel) will fully serve its purpose. If the magician
cannot produce such a sword himself he may have it made by a
smith or another metal expert. The length of the sword may vary
between two or three feet depending on the magician's height.
The handle of the sword may be made of copper, since copper is a
very good conductor of fluids.
<br><br>The shape of the sword does not play an essential role. It need
only be sharpened on one side, but, of course, in can also be
sharpened on both sides. Its point, however, must be well
sharpened. It depends on the individual taste of the magician, if
he has the handle ornamented or provided with suitable symbols.
So much about the manufacturing of a magic sword.
<br><br>The charge of the sword is done by transferring upon it, by
the help of the imagination, the qualities belonging to it, such as
the power over all beings, the absolute victory and the respect due
to it as the symbol of combat, life etc. These qualities have to be
dynamically intensified in the sword by repeated charging. The
magician may also accumulate the light-fluid in the sword in such
a way that it will look like the shining sun or like a flaming
sword, similar to that one which Archangel Michael holds in his
hand in his symbolic pictures.
<br><br>The main point is the attitude of the magician towards the
magic sword accompanied by an unbreakable belief in his absolute
victory in all planes, which will give the sword the necessary
force so that every power, every being will fear and respect it
under any circumstance. After each use the sword has to be wrapped
up in a piece of white or black silk and put away safely like
the other magic implements.
<br><br>The magician may, by practising mental wandering, transfer
the spiritual form of the sword into the mental plane and visit the
planetary spheres taking his magic sword as well as his magic
wand with him. There, according to his wish, he can make use of
his magic power with the help of his magic implements. That
every being will have to obey him in these spheres is clearly evident
by what has been said before. The magician is able, during
his magical operations and evocations, to transfer his mental
sword with his mental hand into the relevant sphere by force of
imagination, and there he can make the being carry out his
wishes. Such a force, however, can only be exerted without
danger by a magician who has a clean heart and a noble soul. If
a sorcerer tried to do the like he would only make the being hate
him and would soon become a victim of them and their influence.
The history of occult science has given many examples of the
tragic fate and even more tragic end of such sorcerers. It would
exeed the extension of this book to talk about certain events in
detail.
<br><br><strong>The Magic Crown, Cap and Magus-Band<A name=crown></A></strong>
<br><br>Always when carrying out operations of ritual magic, no matter
whether evocations, invocations or other operations, the magician
should wear something on his head. He may take, for this
purpose, a golden crown with magic symbols engraved on it, or
he may take a cap or some other headgear with the symbols of the
macrocosm and microcosm of the deity with whom the magician
is connected or whose shape he is taking on. The symbols must
either be drawn with a good colour or embroidered or fastened
with silk. Such a symbol of the macrocosm and microcosm, for
instance, is a hexagon in the middle of two circles inside of which
is the microcosmic symbol of man, the pentagram. If the magician
embroiders his cap himself, or if he has it embroidered by
somebody else, he may choose a golden colour for the circles as a
symbol of infinity; for the hexagon he may take a silvery colour
as the symbol of the created universe, and for the pentagram in
the centre a white or violet colour. Instead of using a cap or a turban
as a headgear, a silk-band, a so-called magus-band, may suffice.
<br><br>This band may be in white, violet or black and is to be
wound round the magician's head. The part running over his
forehead should be ornamented with the macro-microcosmic
symbol, described previously. The symbol may either be embroidered
or drawn on a piece of parchment, thereby using the
colour mentioned above. Instead of the symbol of the macrocosm
some other symbol representing the magician's connection with
the deity may be used. For instance, a cross, which at the same
time, symbolizes the Positive and the Negative, and the ends of
which symbolize the four elements. A rosecross symbol may also
be employed, that is a cross with seven roses in the centre, also
symbolizing the four elements, the Positive and the Negative, and
on top of that, the seven planets. The magician's choice is not, as
can be seen, restricted to a particular symbol. He may express his
spiritual development, his destination, his maturity, his cosmic
relationship by several symbols, whichever he prefers, and he
may wear them on his cap or magus-band.
<br><br>As already mentioned, the crown, cap or magus-band is a symbol
of the dignity of the magician's authority. It is a symbol of the
perfection of his spirit, a symbol of his relationship to the
microcosm and macrocosm, the tiny and the great world, the
highest expression of his magical power, serving him to crown his
head. All articles, no matter whether cap, crown or magus-band,
must be made of the finest material and must serve no other
purposes but operations of ritual magic. As soon as the cap,
crown or magus-band is ready and has been tried out, it should be
sanctified by meditation and a holy oath, so that the magician will
only put it on his head when he is fully absorbed with the idea of
his unity with the deity, and he will only make use of the cap for
operations which demand this kind of symbolism. When speaking
his oath the magician should put his right hand on the cap and
should concentrate, by force of imagination, on the idea that at
the moment he puts the cap on his head he is united with his deity,
or with the symbol ornamenting his cap. Then he should put
his headgear away safely together with his other magical implements.
<br><br>Whenever the magician is prepared for evocations, after having
meditated for this purpose, and puts on his headgear, he will at
once be united with the Deity and will have, not only in himself,
but in the whole space or at the place where he puts it on, that
feeling of a holy temple atmosphere. Therefore the magician will
agree that his headgear is also an intrinsic part of his magical implements,
and that he must draw his full attention towards it.
<br><br>Sorcerers also use caps which are ornamented with symbols of
demons, but only few of them know about their genuine meaning
and correct application, not to mention their actual symbolism.
<br><br>A magician, however, who does everything consciously
can never decline to be a mere sorcerer and will never do
anything he does not understand. Everything he does is done for
a special purpose.
<br><br><strong>The Magical Garment<A name=garment></A></strong>
<br><br>This is to be treated in the same manner as the cap or magusband.
The magical gament is a long robe made of silk, buttoned
from the neck to the toes. The sleeves of the robe end at the
wrists. The robe looks like the vestment of a clergyman and symbolizes
the absolute purity of all ideas, and the purity of the magician's
soul. It is also the symbol of protection. Just as a common
garment protects a man's physical body from outside influences,
rain, cold etc. so the magical garment of the magician shelters him
from outside influences which may attact his body through its
astral or mental matrix. As already mentioned several times, silk
is the best insulating material against any astral or mental influences.
<br><br>A robe made of silk is therefore an excellent means of insulation
and may also be successfully used for other operations
not directly connected with ritual magic; for instance, protection
of the astral or physical body when projecting the mental or
astral body so that no being can take possession of the magician's
astral or physical body without his approval. A magic robe may
also be successfully used for similar operations for which the insulation
of the mental, astral and physical body is necessary. It is,
however, up to the magician which possible variations he wants
to make use of. Under no circumstances may the magician use a
garment for ritual magic or evocations which has been used for
common purposes such as, for example, training, or current
magical operations. A special robe must be taken for this special
kind of magic, and its colour must suit the purpose. Here I should
point out that for common mental and astral operations or experiments,
the insulating garment may be put on top of any other
clothes; for evocations and ritual magic; however, the magical
garment is to be worn over the naked body. The magician may,
however, in cold weather, put on a shirt or pants made of pure
silk und put the robe over them, but the pants or shirt must be of
the same colour as the robe. The magician may use house-shoes of
the same colour as the robe. The soles of the shoes can be made of
leather or rubber.
<br><br>The colour of the robe corresponds to the work, idea and purpose
the magician wishes to carry out. He may choose one of the
three universal colours: white, violet or black. Violet is equivalent
to the Akasha-colour and may be used for nearly all magical
operations. White is chosen for the robe only, when dealing with
high and good beings. Black is the appropriate colour for negative
powers and beings. The magician is able to carry out almost all
ritual operations with these colours. If he can afford the expense, he
can have three robes made, one of each colour. A wealthy magician
may choose, for his robes, colours analogous to the individual
spheres of the planets he works with. Thus he will take for:
<br><br>beings of Saturn - dark-violet
<br>beings of Jupiter - blue
<br>beings of Mars - purple
<br>beings of the Sun - yellow, gold or white
<br>beings of Venus - green
<br>beings of Mercury - opalescent, orange
<br>beings of the Moon - silver or white
<br><br>Of course, only the prosperous magician will be able to afford
such expenditure. A magician not so prosperous will get satisfactory
results with just one robe in a light-violet colour. His cap or
magus-band should be of the same colour.
When the robe is ready, the magician must wash it in running
water in order to de-od it, so that no alien influence will remain
on the silk. Then he must iron the robe by himself, for no other
hands but his should ever come in contact with it. The magician
will find these measures quite justified, for, being very particular
in this respect, he will already find it disturbing if another person,
even if it is someone of his family, of his relations or friends,
merely touches one of his magical implements. The robe prepared
in the manner described must then be put in front of the magician,
who, by help of imagination, must unite himself with his
deity and bless the robe, not as his own person, but as the deity
evoking itself. He must take an oath, that is swear to the garment
that he will only use it for ritual purposes. A dress influenced and
impregnated in such a way then has genuine magical power and
will offer the magician absolute security. Before the magician
prepares his robe for magical purposes he may embroider it, if he
likes, with universal symbols similar to his cap. All this, of
course, entirely depends on his own will and he may rest assured
that he cannot make any mistakes in this respect.
<br><br><strong>The Magical Belt<A name=belt></A></strong>
<br><br>The magical belt is part of the magical garment. Put round the
waist it keeps the whole robe together. The belt is made of the
same material as the robe and cap, but leather may also be used; it
must, however, be of the same colour as the garment. Magicians
of days gone by preferred belts made of lion skin, which they first
made into leather and then into a belt. The skin of a lion was the
symbol eof power, superiority and dominance. The symbolic
meaning of the belt could really be best compared with the
domination over the elements, the magical equilibrium. And the
upper and lower part of a man's body, kept together in the middle
by the belt, symbolizes the scales. The symbol chosen may
either be drawn or carved into the leather or it may be embroidered
on a silk belt. The symbolic drawing of the equilibrium
of the elements and their domination can be made according to
the magician's own ideas. He may, for instance, draw a circle and
inside it a pentagram with one point upward, and in the middle of
the pentagram again a triangle as the symbol of the domination
over the elements of the three planes. In the middle of the triangle
a cross with two arms of the same length should be drawn as the
symbol of the Plus and Minus-principles and their equilibrium.
<br><br>Also in this case the magician should go about as he has done with
the cap and garment, that is he must sanctify and bless the belt
and swear that he will use the belt together with the robe and only
for ritual purposes. The belt will be stored away safely,
together with the robe, in the same place as the other magical implements.
<br><br><strong>Further Magical Aids<A name=further></A></strong>
<br><br>The magician must deal the same way with any further aids
which he may want to use for his ritual purposes as he has with
the magical implements already described. There is still quite a
number of them, and it would lead us too far if I were to deal
with each of them in this book, as magical aids depend on the purpose
and aim for which they are made. Thus, for instance, the
magician needs a special pen, ink, engraving pencil for writing
and engraving, needles for embroidering, embroidery-wool and
embroidery-silk, parchment paper, colours, sacrificial blood for
certain operations, the so-called holy oil, with which he anoints
his implements and himself on certain parts of his body. Salt, incense
or other means for incensing; a whip which he uses in much
the same way as his magic sword, attributing to it the same symbolism.
<br><br>Apart from that he needs a chain as the symbol of the
relationship of the macrocosm with the microcosm with all its
spheres. At the same time the chain is the symbol of the
magician's admittance to the great brotherhood of magicians and
to the hierarchy of all beings of the macrocosm and microcosm.
The chain may be worn round the neck like a piece of jewellery
and indicates that the magician is a member of the association of
all true and genuine magicians.
<br><br>For certain magical operations a cup is also used as the symbol
of wisdom and life. During certain magical operations the magician
gets his holy meal, his eucharist, the holy communion out of
this cup. A cup filled with wine is used to charge the wine with
the divine power similar to the holy communion of Christians.
<br><br>The charging of the cup is to be carried out in such a way that the
magician transforms himself into a deity, then blesses the wine,
thus transforming it into the divine blood - wisdom, power, life.
During work-breaks the magician drinks this transformed wine
and so takes part in the holy sacrament. I have already dealt with
this subject in "Initiation into Hermetics" in the chapter on the
eucharist.
<br><br>A bell may also serve as a magical aid for evocations. Such a bell
should be made of electro-magicum, that is a prescribed mixture
of all the metals of the planets. The magician uses this when he
wants to draw the attention of the invisible world to himself.
This is done by rhythmic ringing. The rhythm and the number
of chimes depends on the number-rhythms of the sphere with
which the magician wants to have communication. This oriental
method is scarcely used by true magicians. In the east, especially
in Tibet, this kind of evocation by bell-ringing, cymbal-beating
etc., is often practised.
<br><br>I have already mentioned that all these implements must be
new and never used for any other purpose except the one to
which they are dedicated. Each implement must be put away safely
after use. If it is no longer needed or if the magician does not intend
to use it any more, the implement has to be destroyed or
rendered innocuous. If one would use a magical implement for
any other purposes, it would become desecrated and magically ineffectual.
All magic implements have to be handled as if they were relics.
The more carefully the magician handles his magical implements,
the greater will be their magical power and effect.
<br><br><strong>The Pentacle, Lamen or Seal<A name=pentacle></A></strong>
<br><br>The difference between a pentacle and a seal is that the pentacle is
a universal symbol of power and must be charged with the
qualities of the relevant power by help of the magic wand or imagination;
its purpose is to induce awe and obedience in a being,
so that it fulfills the magician's will. The shape of the universal
symbol depends on the religious attitude of the magician. The
same universal symbol of power which the magician has embroidered
or engraved in his headgear (crown, cap, magus-band)
may be used for instance, a hexagram constructed within two
circles in the middle of which rests a pentagram. In the centre of
the pentagram is a cross which has arms of the same length. A
cross alone may also serve as a universal symbol.
<br><br>Many magicians make use of the Pentacle Salomonis as a symbol
of coercion for all beings. The magician surely will not choose
a symbol the construction of which he would not find analogous
to the universal laws, for with such a symbol he could not make
obvious the authority he needs for his purposes. Only by completely
understanding the meaning of his symbol and by being
able to take the right attitude towards it will the magician get true
magical results. A magician should always think of this. He
should only use symbols which are clear to him in meaning and
which represent the idea of his power.
<br><br>A seal, contrary to the pentacle, is the graphic representation of
a being, power or sphere which is expressed by its symbolism.
<br><br>The existing types of seals are:
<br><br>1. The traditional seals which have either been found by clairvoyance
or have been reproduced by spirit beings during astral
visits to the various spheres. Beings will only react to this kind of
seal if the magician knows how to transfer himself into their
sphere of power. Due to a constant increase of the magician's
reservoir of power, caused by frequent use of one and the same
seal, he will also increase his influence and be able to make it
work on the being in question.
<br><br>The copying and reproduction of seals, however, has been the
source of many errors, and the seals have often been corrupted.
Sometimes this has been done deliberately in order to make the
magician's work more difficult and his success with this material
less probable or even totally impossible. A magician with an open
mind for astral operations may, if he likes, check the genuineness
of the seal by use of the Akasha-principle, or trance, and by placing
his total concentration on the seal. By doing this, he will also
be able to correct the seal.
<br><br>2. There also exist universal seals which not only symbolize the
qualities and range of action of beings but also their other
characteristics. By applying the laws of analogy one may produce
graphic constructions of such seals and charge them with the
qualities of the relevant spirits by force of imagination. The
being will have to react to such seals without resistance.
<br><br>3. The magician may also produce seals entirely according to his
own ideas, without following any analogous relations. He must,
however, have such seals approved by the being concerned. The
being's approval of such a seal or sign can be established as
follows: the magician wanders with his spirit into the being's own
sphere and has the being swear mentally to his seal, its shape, or
representation, that it will always react to it.
<br><br>A lamen is very similar to a universal symbol, but is not a symbol
of the microcosm and macrocosm: it represents symbolically
the intellectual and psychic authority, the attitude and the
maturity of the magician. The lamen is usually sewn to the magician's
garment, somewhere on his chest, or it is specially engraved
into a suitable piece of metal, or drawn on a piece of parchment
Ind worn like an amulet. It expresses, by its symbolic presentation,
the absolute authority of the magician.
<br><br>The magician will avail himself of a talisman if, during magical
operations, he needs protection from unwanted influences, or if
he wants to have an outstanding success with his magical operations.
<br><br>The talisman may be the graphic representation of the
qualities and faculties with which it has been loaded. The charging
of the talisman has to be effected either by the magician
himself or by a being evoked by him. If it is done by a being, the
power necessary for the charging will have to come from the beings'
own power or reservoir of power. In this case the traditional
signs, that is, signs which have been conferred upon the magician
by another magician, or that came direct from a being, may also
be engraved on the talisman. The magician, however, may also
make use of relating signs which he has had approved by the relevant
being.
<br><br>Pentacles, lamens, seals or talismans to be used for ritual purposes
may be made of suitable metals analogous to the beings'
sphere, to the elements, planets or signs of the zodiac and the seals
or signs engraved on them, or they may be engraved on small
wax-plates which the magician has made by himself from pure
bee's-wax and afterwards charged. Pentacles, seals and talismans
may also be made of parchment and the symbols then painted or
drawn on them with the corresponding colours in drawing ink.
<br><br>The old grimoires suggest the use of virgin parchment, i. e. the
paper made from the skin of a prematurely born calf. The genuine
magician will not need such parchment. A piece of common
parchment which, by means of his imagination, he has deoded,
i. e. freed from all bad influences, will do him the same kind of
service. He may also use, for his seal or pentacle, a piece of blotting
paper impregnated with a fluid condenser, but, in this case,
he cannot draw the symbol with liquid colours; he must use a soft
coloured pencil, otherwise the colours will blot when drawing
the seals or signs.
<br><br>The charge of the seal, pentacle, talisman or lamen is done by
running the finger over the drawing, and by the help of one's imagination,
impregnating it with the desired characteristic. It is
clear that by doing this the magician must be in genuine contact
with the Supreme, with the Deity, so that it is actually the Deity,
and not the magician, who charges the seal etc. via the magician,
or the magician's body. Instead of using his finger the magician
may also take his magic wand and by its help charge the seal or
talisman. That such a talisman etc. will then have magic power
goes without doubt, for by this procedure it becomes consecrated
and the magician will be quite convinced of its magic effect.
The seals of the various beings will be dealt with in detail in the
chapter on the hierarchy of the beings and their qualities and effects.
<br><br><strong>The Book of Magic Formulae<A name=formulae></A></strong>
<br><br>In all works that have so far been written on ritual magic, the
Magic Book, the Book of Magic Formulae, i. e. the book that contains
the incantations for the beings or spirits to be conjured or
evoked has been regarded as the most important part of the magic
of evocation, but its contents have so often been misinterpreted
that we will do well to try to get a clear picture of it from the
hermetic point of view.
<br><br>It is quite wrong to believe that all that has to be done is to buy
a book and write into it the magic charms and incantations of
evocation or that it will suffice if these formulae are learned by
heart and in consequence the desired being evoked. The grimoires
which we have so far been able to examine, no matter whether
they were old or modern ones, all contain the same mistake as far
as the interpretation of the book of formulae is concerned. True
initiates cannot help laughing at these mystifications though feeling
sorry for the people who, by such misinterpretation, will get
no positive results. Looking at it from one point of view it is correct
to write about magic formulae in a mysterious way, and not
give away their secrets too easily, in order to avoid profanation.
But since this book is only written for readers with high ethical
Ind moral standards and since only mature people will be in a
position to follow its instructions successfully and to understand
and truly acquire what we have to say about true initiations, I
shall talk about this quite openly too.
<br><br>First of all the book of formulae is not to be understood in a
literal sense, for the expression "magic spells" or "magical formulae"
used in the grimoires has served as a cloak for certain
ideas. In other cases its object has been to take away the
magician's consciousness from its normal state by barbaric words,
names and expressions, and thus bring him into a state of ecstasy
in which, it is assumed, he is able to influence a being. But generally
speaking, the only success that untrained persons will have in
this case, is hallucinations, phantoms or delusions, or incomplete,
mediumistic results which need not be dealt with here. Usually
such mediumistic results are, provided that they are genuine at
all, the outcome of the extoriorisation of the person's unconsciousness.
<br><br>Sometimes elementals, and, should the person concerned
have a strong capability for emanation, even elementaries
might be formed which the genuine magician has already been informed
about in "Initiation into Hermetics". These elementaries
are falsely regarded as the beings which are the object of evocation,
and a person whose astral senses have not yet been sufficiently
developed is not able to tell the difference or to control
the situation. Therefore readers are warned against trying to practise
ritual magic without necessary training. Apart from disappointments,
the disturbances in the person's spirit and soul could
have most regrettable consequences for the health. A genuine
magician who has completed his magical training, may, however,
without any danger whatever, safely practise ritual magic. This
field of magic is no place for dabbler's experiments but a scheme
of operation which facilitates the magical labour for the mature
magician with already developed powers.
<br><br>The book of formulae, sometimes wrongly called the book of
spirits, is the genuine magical diary of the magician practising
ritual magic, in which he enters, step by step, the procedures of
his ritual in order to be able to follow every point conscientiously
up to his goal. Some readers might wish to know how mutilated
charms, furmulae for incantation etc. could ever develop? From
the days of yore the secret of magic has been restricted to high
castes, potentates, kings and high priests. In order that the real
truth, that true ideas and spiritual facts might never be known by
the public, many code-words and secret formulae have been introduced,
the deciphering of which has been reserved to the
mature. The key for these codes was only transferred upon
mature persons by word of mouth, and their profanation was
punished with death. This is the reason why this science has remained
a secret up to our time and it will continue to remain an
occult and mystic science even if it is directly published, as the immature
und profane person will regard it all as delusion or fantastic
nonsense and, depending on his grade of maturity and
psychic receptivity, will always have at hand an individual interpretation
or view of this science. The most secret matters will
thus never lose their occult tradition and there will always be but
a few people who will profit by it. If a person who is not an initiate
gets such a book of magic formulae in his hands and does
not know the key to it, he will take everything in its literal sense
without knowing that the particular words and formulae are
nothing but aids for the magician's memory and that it is a
schematic layout for the ritual work of a true magician. This
makes it clear why sometimes the most senseless words have been
used as magic charms to evoke a certain being. But the book of
formulae is a proper note-book in which the genuine magician
writes the whole procedure of his magic operations from beginning
to end. If he is not sure that his book will never fall into the
hands of another person, he will have to use, point by point,
code-names. I can only give here a few instructions. These will,
however, enable the magician to procede according to his own
taste and ideas.
<br><br>1. Purpose of the operation
<br>2. The being, power, sphere etc. to be evoked
<br>3. The place selected for the magical operation
<br>4. Preparation of all magical implements needed for the operation
<br>5. The actual magical operation
<br>6. Assuming the shape of the deity controlling the being concerned,
that is connection with the relevant deity, its attributes,
faculties etc.
<br>7. The drawing of the magic circle according to the magician's
connection with the deity. If the operations are carried out
with a magic circle sewn on a piece of linen, piece of cloth, or
the like, it has to be re-drawn
<br>8. Drawing of the magic triangle
<br>9. Putting censer into the correct place, including, if necessary,
the way of censering
<br>10. Lighting of the magic lamp, including meditative attitude to
cause intuition and enlightenment
<br>11. Charge of the seals, pentacles or lamens of the being desired
<br>12. Charge of the magic mirror, or several magic mirrors,
depending on the special purposes they are to serve
<br>13. Putting on of the magical garment and meditative attitude to
cause protection, purity etc.
<br>14. Putting on of the magical headgear - crown, cap or magusband
and meditation to bring about the contact with the deity
<br>15. Girding on the magical belt with the right attitude to bring
about the magician's power to control all powers, especially
the elements
<br>16. Girding on magic sword to magic belt with the meditative attitude
of absolute victory; re-charging, with magic wand in
the right and concentrating on the idea that the magician's
absolute will be realised
<br>17. Entering of the magic circle with the simultaneous feeling of
ties and symbolization of the microcosm and macrocosm
<br>18. Concentration on the magic space, that is the complete
elimination of the ideas of time and space
<br>19. Repeated contact with one's deity
<br>20. Placing of the magician's whole personality into the relevant
mental sphere with all his implements
<br>21. Giving orders to the being or power of that sphere in regard
to its evocation and imaginative forming of shape in which
the being or power is to appear in the magic triangle or magic
mirror
<br>22. Returning with consciousness to the operating room
<br>23. Wanting or ordering a spirit to communicate a message or do
a certain job in whatever sphere necessary
<br>24. Conscious dismissing of the being, at the end of operations,
to the sphere from which it has been evoked and the finishing
of the operation by saying a prayer of thanks
<br>25. Storing up of all magical implements, including the magic circle
etc.
<br>26. Entering the total course of operation, the time it needed, its
success etc. into the Book of Formulae.
<br><br>The genuine magician has to compute his book of formulae in
this or a similar manner and, in consequence, has to procede by it.
If he is acquainted with the knowledge of quabbalah, he may use
the names of the relevant deities whenever he is placing his consciousness
into a certain sphere. This is however just another of
his aids, a support to his memory, and the true magician will be
able to do without it. The first operation will presumably always
be a little uncertain, but time will teach the magician everything
he needs in this respect and he will, sooner or later, become a
perfect master in this field of magic. Hard work will bring its
reward.
<br><br><strong>In the Domain of the Spirit Beings<A name=domain></A></strong>
<br><br>Before describing a true magical operation and evocation I must
make the reader acquainted with the spheres of the beings. A genuine
magician is not allowed to do anything unless he knows
fully what he is doing and unless he has a clear picture of what he
intends to achieve. As the magician will have learned from the
preceding chapter on the book of formulae, it is extremely important
to know the correct handling and analogies of the
magical implements, for without this thorough knowledge their
analogies and symbolism it would be impossible to get any
positive results. Further, the magician would not be able to find
the genuine attitude for his meditations and to rise his spirit into
the right sphere of consciousness. His magical implements would
become an illusion and he would be lowered to the level of a common
sorcerer. He could neither make his magical authority work
on the beings, nor could he influence them in any way. The genuine
magician does everything consciously; he has laid down
each procedure systematically in his book of formulae before his
operations, and his mind, his consciousness, is connected with his
implements, their faculties, loadings etc. He must be just as well
informed about the spheres of the being with which he wants to
work. He must be able to pass a clear judgement on the existence
and doings of these beings. His own experience will help him a
great deal in this respect, for he will have visited, with his mental
body, various spheres as suggested in "Initiation into Hermetics".
The following discussions are therefore a short summary of the
magician's experiences on his visits to the said spheres.
<br><br>Only the confirmed materialist, who, with his physical senses,
does not perceive anything else but the material world and who
only believes in what he sees, hears and feels, will doubt that
there are other spheres beside this material world. The genuine
magician will not give any judgement upon a materialist and will
not try to dissuade him from his views. The materialist is in the
state of maturity, in this physical world, which corresponds to his
personal development. The magician will therefore make no effort
to teach a materialist better, for the latter will always end by
saying that he has never seen a spirit and therefore only believes
in the things he has been able to perceive with his physical
faculties, that is to see, hear or feel. The materialist does not deny
the matter, he agrees that the material and power in which he
lives must exist, but to believe that there exist other, more subtle
spheres of material or power goes beyond his horizon. Therefore
the magician never tries to influence the belief of another human
being, for the non-initiate will always have his individual opinion
of higher facts, and will always judge from his own point of view.
<br><br>Just the same as our physical world exists in three different
states: solid, fluid and gaseous, so exist, following the laws of
analogy, certain states of aggregation in a more subtle form,
which are not accessible to our normal senses, but which are,
however, connected with our physical world. These states of aggregation
are called, from the hermetic point of view, planes and
spheres. In these more subtle spheres the same things happen as in
our physical world, and there, too, the Law of the Hermes
diagram is valid: that which is above is as that which is below.
The same powers are in action there, just the same as on our
planet. Here as well as there the same kind of influences work.
<br><br>Therefore, in every sphere we have the same play of elements, the
electric and magnetic fluid, which is maintained and controlled
by Divine Providence according to the Akasha-principle. The person
relying only on what he perceives with his five physical
senses has only one sphere open to perception: the sphere corresponding
to his physical senses, and he is not able to procede
beyond it. Everything else must remain inconceivable, incredible
and supersensual to him. The genuine magician, who has refined
and developed his senses by mental and psychic training, will only
consider this physical world as the starting point of his personal
development and will never deny the existence of higher
spheres because he is able to convince himself of their existence.
<br><br>That these spheres are more subtle and more compact states of aggregation
has long become obvious to the true magician by his
own personal experience. The magician will always be able to
visit with his mental body the sphere corresponding to the state
of development of his mental body's senses, and to be active in it.
He must always bear this in mind when practising the magic of
evocation. Naturally, these more subtle spheres are not subject to
our ideas of space and time but go into one another in our terms,
so that for instance, in a space which, in our imagination, is
always somehow bordered and furnished with limits, many different
spheres may be present.
<br><br>Depending on the grade of subtlety or density, there are innumerable
spheres and intermediate spheres. To name them all
here would be impossible. I will only mention those which are of
importance for the practice of magic. Their graded density is called
hierarchy. Before a magician plans to work on these spheres he
must have a conception of their hierarchy, and must be well acquainted
with the sphere in which he intends to work, first
theoretically and later, of course, also practically. But, above all,
he must have a thorough command over the physical sphere
before he proceeds to the more subtle one next to it. Each of these
spheres of hierarchy have their particular influence on our
physical world according to the laws of analogy. With regard to
the planetary spheres astrologers have discovered a somehow
workable synthesis, but unfortunately the astrologers of today
uses this chiefly only for mantic purposes, and it is hardly known
that astrology actually only gives a partial explanation of the influences
of these spheres, of planets and zodiacal signs. The
astrological part of the higher spheres will not be dealt with here,
for it does not come within the scope of this book. The true magician,
however, will find a much closer relation between the individual
spheres, if he deals with astrology, and will notice that
astrology shows the true influences of the relevant spheres on our
physical world, in their causes and effects.
<br><br>The grading of the spheres according to their grade of density
and their qualities is called, in Quabbalah, the quabbalistic Tree
of Life. The analogies and their practical application from the
quabbalistic point of view will be dealt with by me in detail in my
forthcoming book: "The Key to the True Quabbalah". This
book is to rouse the readers interests in the spheres of the quabbalistic
Tree of Life as far as they may serve magic purposes, that
is as far as their beings are concerned. The spheres in their correct
order are:
<br><br>1. The physical world as the starting point for the work of the
magician, in which every human being, no matter whether initiated
into hermetics or not, lives and moves with his senses, his
spirit, his soul and his body.
<br><br>2. The next higher sphere existing above the physical world is
the earth zone, the zone girdling the earth. This zone has various
grades of density, so-called sub-zones into which man proceeds
after having put off his earthly shape. This is the so-called astral
world; in its lower grades of density dwell the average persons in
their astral bodies after their physical death, in its higher spheres
are also initiates, depending on their state of maturity. The more
mature, more developed, more ethical a magician is, the more
subtle is the zone layer in which he comes after his death. His
place in the astral world will depend on how far he advanced during
his life in this physical world. There is no heaven or hell in
the astral world; these are merely the outcome of silly religious
opinions and the object of the teachings of some religions which,
due to their ignorance, separate life in the astral world into life in
heaven or hell. If one regards the lower, rougher spheres of the
astral world as being the hell, the brighter, higher spheres as the
heaven, part of these religious beliefs could be true. The magician
who knows how to interpret such symbols and ideas will find his
own explanation for the expressions "hell", "heaven" and
"purgatory".
<br><br>It would go too far to tell the reader all about life in the astral
world. Many books could be written on this subject. I will, nevertheless,
give a few hints of interest to the magician. The magician
will have experienced during his mental and astral wanderings,
when his mental and astral body was split off, that in the astral
sphere the ideas of time and space do not exist for him, so that in
one single moment he is able to travel any distance and on his
way there are no material hindrances which he would not be able
to penetrate with his mental and astral body. Every human being
will have the same experience after his physical death. The initiate,
however, has the advantage of getting acquainted with this
fact during his lifetime, and that already in this material world he
is liberated of one sorrow: the fear of death. He knows well in
which astral sphere he will live after his death, and for him the
putting away of his physical body is only a transition from the
physical world into a more subtle one, similar to changing his
place of residence.
<br><br>The magician will experience yet another thing here on earth:
all interests that are normal with an average, that is an
undeveloped, non-initiated person in this physical world, will
cease in the astral plane. Therefore it is not at all surprising that a
genuine magician, who is equally familiar with the conditions
here and there, that is in the physical and the astral world, loses
his interests in this physical world, as far as he does not regard it
as the means for his personal development. He will already learn
here on earth that fame, honour, riches and all other earthly advantages
cannot be taken from here to the astral world and are
therefore useless. A true magician will therefore never cry for
mortal things. His interest will constantly be directed to using the
time which he has at his disposal in this physical sphere to the
best of his abilities for his personal development.
<br><br>It is therefore quite clear that all bonds like love, fidelity etc.
which might keep a human being in this physical world come to
nothing there. People who have loved each other here, but have
not kept the same pace in their psychic and mental development
cannot, after dying, live in the same sphere and they will no
longer feel the same affection for each other as they have done
here. If, for instance, a man and a woman are equally developed
they can move in the same sphere of the astral world after their
death and will be connected by an inner band of sympathy to
each other, but, in spite of this, they will not experience the same
kind of love as they did in the physical world. In the astral world
there exists nothing like the instinct for self-preservation, the instinct
for carnal, sexual love and sexual lust. In the higher spheres
a different feeling of affection than on earth connects two equally
developed beings by a subtle band of vibration. In our physical
world the sympathy or attraction of two beings is usually caused
by external stimulation and maintained by the same factors.
<br><br>Naturally, this is not so in the astral world. The idea of beauty in
the astral world, too, is quite different from the idea of beauty in
this physical world. Since a deceased person is no longer subject
to time and space when entering the astral sphere and thus in that
world loses the means to measure its degree of perfection, it longs
to return to the earth. The human being not only longs to return
because he must equalize, by force of the Law of Karma of cause
and effect, the errors he made during his lifetime but he also longs
to come back to have another chance of development in the
physical world and to gather further experiences, in his spirit, for
the higher spheres of the astral world.
<br><br>Every human being, after having died, will realise yet another
fact in the astral world: having only a low degree of development,
he will not be able to communicate with beings who, during their
lifetime, have reached a higher degree of development, because
these beings will stay in a higher, more subtle sphere of the astral
world, and he himself will not be able to travel to their sphere of
light. Even if he were able to move to those higher spheres he
would not be able to stand the elevated vibration there and would
drop back, that is he would soon find himself transferred to that
astral sphere in which he belongs on account of his degree of
development. A person with a high degree of perfection,
however, is able to place himself into a lower sphere by accomodating
the vibration of that sphere in his spirit.
<br><br>If, therefore, a spirit with a low degree of development wants to
get into contact with a spirit of a higher degree of development,
the former must ask the latter, by force of imagination, to come
to his sphere. Whether the higher developed being will fulfill the
wish of the lower being, always depends on the purpose for
which the lower being calls the higher one. This clearly shows
that a lower being is not capable of moving to the higher spheres
of the astral world. The contrary, however, is quite possible. A
magician with a good degree of development is able to place
himself iilto any sphere, for he is capable of accomodating and
creating every kind of vibration and any form of every sphere
he wants to get into touch with. Many a reader will here
remember the words of the Bible and perceive its meaning:
"And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
it not".
<br><br>The experienced magician knows that the physical body is sustained
by food (that is: condensed elements) and that the breath
connects the astral with the physical body by the so-called astral
band. Therefore he is also aware of the fact that as soon as, at the
moment of dying, a person's breath stops, the separation of the
astral and mental body from the physical body takes place. He
will also find it quite logical that whenever, due to his magical
training, he consciously separates not only the mental but also
the astral body from his physical body, he will be put into a state
of ecstasy or apparent death during which his breath has also
stopped, with the only difference that his physical body, during
this state of ecstasy, is not subject to decay, and a connection is
still maintained with the mental and astral body. Since the magician
can have power over life and death, if approved by Divine
Providence, he is able to restore this connecting link in order to
make a dead person live again, similar to the saints, who, as we
know from history, have been able to do the same. I have already
dealt with this matter in detail in "Initiation into Hermetics".
<br><br>If the magician has experienced his physical death, there is no
reason why he should return to the physical world, and he is not
desirous of restoring the band between the material and astral
worlds. Of course, there are also magicians and sorcerers of lower
degree, who consciously try, from the astral world, to build again
the link between their astral and their physical bodies. But
because they lack the necessary perfection enabling them to condense
the light sufficiently, their success must remain a partial
one. Usually such beings, clinging to their physical shape, try to
evade the pre-conditions for such a realisation and vampirise the
electro-magnetic fluid (vital energy) from living bodies in order to
accumulate it in their abandoned physical bodies, assuming that
in the course of time they will be able to revive them. The
physical body laid aside by such a being in the manner indicated
may be saved from decay for centuries. History gives us many examples
of the conservation of deceased persons, and science cannot
yet give any satisfactory explanation for this. Such vampires
are, from the hermetic point of view, to be pitied, and the
religious belief of those days did well in destroying such bodies
which did not decay. Usually only by this destruction, such a
body was usually pierced with a wooden spear or its head cut off
and the body itself burned, was the spirit of such a body freed
from its bondage. The sagas of the werewolves, too, can be explained
from the hermetic point of view. The procedure was the
same, only that at the moment of vampirizing, the astral body
took on the shape of an animal in order to evade recognition by
the possibly sensitive person who was vampirized.
<br><br>In summing up: in the physical world the physical and the
astral bodies are kept together by food and breath and all the
three parts - body, soul and spirit - are strengthened from the
higher spheres by more subtle material elements during the sleep.
In the astral world, on the other hand, the astral body is enlivened
by the impressions it gets by material vibrations in the astral
sphere. If a human being is returning from the astral world into
the physical world, then the band between the astral and the mental
bodies rends so that the being dies there to be reborn in our
physical world. The act of dying there is similar to physical death;
the astral body is no longer fed by the mental body with impressions
from the astral world.
<br><br>The process of decay of an astral body takes much longer than
that of a physical body, and an astral body may go on to exist for
many years, according to our chronology, without being maintained
by the respective spirit. Other beings, usually demons, like
to take possession of such corpses in order to play tricks with
them. During numerous spiritistic sessions the astral bodies of
dead people have appeared which were abandoned by the spirits
of those dead people a long time ago and have since been controlled
and used by a demon. Only a well trained clairvoyant who is
able to distinguish an astral body from a mental body by the help
of his well developed mental senses can discover the truth. Such
demons like to fool people, play tricks on them and make all
kinds of mischief. All imps and spooks, phantoms, hobgoblins,
and the like, proceed in the same manner.
<br><br>I have already discussed this matter thoroughly in "Initiation
into Hermetics". Normally, an astral body slowly dissolves to its
elements, the so-called astral corpse is sucked up by the elements,
becomes more and more transparent, similar to a sieve, until it
finally totally decays into the material of the individual elements.
Besides man, who after his death betakes himself to the astral
plane, many other beings dwell in the earth-zone. Apart from
those already mentioned, for instance elementals, larvae, phantoms,
goblins, there also exist, in that zone, the beings of the
elements. I shall deal more with these individual beings of the
elements and their heads in the chapter dealing with hierarchies.
Each spirit which wants to declare itself in one way or another
must pass through the astral world, regardless from which sphere
it comes, even if it should live in the highest spheres. For the zone
lirdling the earth is the first zone beyond the physical world. In
quabbalah, this zone is also called Malkuth; that means Kingdom.
I shall have more to say about this in "The Key to the True Quabbalah".
<br><br>In the astral world of the zone girdling the earth the same
powers exist and are at work as in the physical world; they are,
however, more subtle. Also there dominates the element of the
fire with its salamanders or spirits of fire, the element of water
with its water-spirits and undines, the element of the air with its
fairies and sylphs or spirits of the air, and the element of the earth
with its gnomes or spirits of the earth. All the beings in the astral
sphere of the earth-zone move about in their respective elements
just as the fish in the waters of the earth moves about correspondingly
in its element. Each element has positive and negative beings
so that we may talk of good as well as of evil salamanders.
<br><br>The same is true of the beings of the other elements. In reality,
however, there exists neither good nor evil, for Divine Providence
created nothing bad or inharmonious, it is only a human
comprehension to assume this. From the hermetic point of view
the one kind of beings have good the other bad influences, thus
have its good and bad effects respectively. These beings are, in the
astral world, the tools for the things that happen in our physical
world. They are the cause of all effects in the astral body of each
being, no matter whether initiate or non-initiate.
<br><br>The actions and doings of the element of air and the element of
fire in the astral sphere cause the astral-electric fluid; the actions
and doings of the water-element and the element of the earth
cause the astral-magnetic fluid. The beings use the fluids in order
to create the effects, or, better said, the causes in our physical
world. The Akasha-principle of the astral sphere keeps all the
elements of the astral sphere in harmonious equilibrium. If a being
of the astral sphere wants to influence our physical world, no
matter whether it be a spirit of the elements or a human being, it
must be capable of condensing both fluids, the electric as well as
the magnetic, in such a manner that they are realized in the
physical world. A well-trained magician who has a good command
of the elements and fluids is able to carry out this act of
condensing quite by himself, by the help of the imagination.
When taking no active part in the work himself, he may have the
condensation carried out by a medium from whom in this case,
the spirits will extract, like vampires, the electric and magnetic
fluid necessary to bring about the desired effect.
<br><br>As is well known, the difference between a being of the
elements and a human being lies in the fact that a being of the
elements consists of only one element, whereas a human being is
composed of all four elements, plus a fifth one: the Akasha-principle.
<br><br>An elemental being can only work with the element
and the fluid to which it appertains; a human being, however,
may become acquainted with all powers and may learn to control
them. But in both cases, whether being of elements or human being,
Divine Providence or the Akasha-principle is the determining
factor. However, a human being is capable of incarnation, a
being of the elements is not able to do this by itself. The astral
body of a being of the elements breaks up into its element; a
human astral body dissolves into the four elements. Another difference
is the fact that with the moment of death an elemental being
ceases to exist, for its spirit is mortal; man, who is something
like a small macrocosm, possesses, since he has been created in
God's image, an immortal individual spirit. Although it is possible
to make, out of a being computed of only one element, a fourelement-
being by special magical operations and to give it an immortal
spirit, a true magician will do this very seldom, and never
without special reasons which must be valid enough to be
justified before Divine Providence.
<br>The Akasha-principle of the astral sphere determines also the
re-incarnation into the physical world of a human being living in
the astral world. The astral material of light, usually called astral
light, is the most divine emanation in the astral world. To initiates
who see the divine principle of the astral world this lightprinciple
appears as bright as the light of the burning sun or as the
sun itself, provided they were in the physical world able to
behold Divine Providence in the Light without having their deity
transformed into a particular shape. The individual religion of a
person has its due place in the astral world insomuch as he has attributed
a certain shape and name to his deity according to his
religious views in the physical world. Atheists feel no necessity
for a God even in the astral world and are therefore not able to
form an idea of the deity there. Nevertheless, they long for
something higher, much like a thirsty man longs for water. People
who have believed in several religions or deities during their
existance on earth will find chaotic conditions. They will have a
difficult time there, if they are not able to make up their minds to
follow a certain form. However, during their course of development
in the astral world their conception of God will be clarified
so that finally they will believe in the deity which was really best
for them. This conception of God then usually determines the
place of their re-incarnation.
<br><br>A magician having explored during his lifetime, the astral
sphere of the zone girdling the earth will know from his own experience,
how the powers and beings of the astral sphere operate
and what they do, but he may also learn it from those beings with
which he is working magically.
<br><br>Just the same as the not yet fully developed magician in the
physical world uses a spiritual guide for his training and likes to
be taught by him, either by passive communication or automatic
writing etc., a not yet perfect human being too will find his
guides in the astral world. These guides will teach him from time
to time and assist him whenever necessary. Highly developed
spiritual beings of the zone girdling the earth condense
themselves in their appropriate astral sphere and thus become the
guides of individuals, or of groups of individuals, and initiate the
astral beings of lower perfection into the higher laws. Such guides
must never be compelled to do their work in the astral world;
they are commissioned by Divine Providence to offer assistance
to any astral being, depending on its maturity and state of perfection.
<br><br>In the astral world, the guide, one may also call him genius
loci, not only teaches his protege the laws, but assists him in his
whole development. It sometimes happens that an astral man
wants to do something at his own accord, but is warned at the
critical moment by his guide or genius not to do anything arbitrarily.
The genius will intervene especially in those cases where
an astral human being with a low degree of development is about
to do something contrary to the laws of Divine Providence. The
guide informs his protege about the laws of the physical world
and prepares him for his rebirth. This clearly shows how
necessary it is that the magical development of a human being
during his time in the physical world leads him towards perfection
in order to be prepared for life in a higher sphere.
<br><br>All blows of fate that are apt to purify a man's spirit in the
physical world and that will help him to get the kind of experience
necessary for his spiritual development are already
prepared and determined by Divine Providence in the astral
world for each individual according to his maturity and degree of
development. The human being knows before his embodiment
about the matter of teaching in the physical world and not only
agrees to it, but even longs to get through it. At the moment of
his rebirth he loses his knowledge about everything that Divine
Providence has planned for him. If an individual living in this
world could know in advance everything he has to go through, he
would no longer have a free will in the physical world. Such an
individual would be equivalent to a mere robot in all his doings
or an automaton, and the task which he would have to complete
in this world would become impracticable. Only an initiate of
higher degree, being master over Karma, that is over cause and effect,
and feeling equally familiar with the physical as well as the
astral world is mature enough to know everything in advance
without having to fear any disadvantageous influences on his free
will.
<br><br>Beings incarnate themselves from the astral world into the
physical sphere of our planet, bordered by time and space, in
order to work on their development, since the material laws of
this plane put far more hindrances in front of every individual
than is the case in the astral sphere. The impediments of the
physical world strengthen the spirit and enable it to grow more
rapidly in its development than it would be possible in the astral
world. Therefore the human beings of the astral world are urged
to achieve re-incarnation in this world as soon as possible, and are
ready to accept even the toughest conditions in order to be able to
continue their spiritual development.
<br><br>Every man can reach perfection, for the evolution of the whole
of mankind leads towards it. The spiritual guide designated to
each individual by Divine Providence for his initiation into the
astral world leads and controls the spiritual development of his
protege and in many cases carries on with his commission after
his protege has re-incarnated in the physical world. The magician
should therefore try at the very beginning of his development to
get into contact with his genius. How this is achieved has already
been told in "Initiation into Hermetics". It sometimes happens
that people who have already reached a high degree of perfection
here on earth are able to continue their spiritual development in
the astral world up to perfection, but these are selected by Divine
Providence to fulfill one or more missions on earth. Such
spiritual leaders are then magicians or initiates by birth who at a
certain phase of the physical development of their human bodies,
usually shortly after the period of puberty, become suddenly
aware of their state, their degree of spiritual development, and
just need a little more to be mature enough for their divine mission.
Such missions need not always be of a magical or spiritual
nature, they may also have to do with other aspects of this world.
<br><br>This explains the birth of human genii and inventors in all fields
of material knowledge. The magician knows that all this is planned
and controlled by Divine Providence, that is on the principles
of Akasha in the astral world, and that nothing can take place
which, from the magician's point of view, could not be explained
by the universal laws.
<br><br>This has been a rough sketch of the most important aspects of
the astral sphere of the so-called earth-zone or zone girdling the
earth, which is the zone next to our physical world. The earthzone
is, according to human thinking, not the most condensed
form of sphere in spite of its being placed above us, since in it
there exist the most various intensities of light, or vibration, in accordance
with the degree of maturity of each individual human
being. This earth-zone is by no means bordered in any way; it
stretches out over the cosmos, not only over the ball of the earth.
<br><br>The laws ruling this zone have nothing to do with the idea of
space, however, as they go for the whole microcosm and
macrocosm and their analogous connection. This is the reason
why man can only reach his perfection, his ultimate magical
maturity, and his genuine connection with the deity, in this zone
girdling the earth. This clearly shows that, from the point of view
of magic, the earth-zone is the lowest sphere, but at the same time
also the sphere with the highest emanation of the Divine Principle. I shall
show further that there exist further spheres belonging
to this hierarchy which the magician is able to contact, but he
is able to live in the earth-zone also as a being of perfection, as the
true image of God. In this zone girdling the earth the whole creation
from the highest perfection of the deity down to the lowest
and roughest form is manifested. A human being may get into
contact with all kinds of spheres which lie above the earth-zone,
but he cannot become their constant inhabitant, because the
earth-zone is the reflecting mirror of the whole creation. It is the
manifested world of all degrees of condensation. The old Quabbalists
knew this truth and therefore called the earth-zone
"Malkuth", which does not mean earth ball, but Kingdom, by
which expression creation from its highest to its lowest
manifestation is meant. According to the Tree of Life of the
Quabbalah it contains the quabbalistic number ten, which stands
for the beginning of evolution. To the person acquainted with
Quabbalah this number ten is the reflection of number one in its
most subtle form, that is, God, for the number ten may be reduced
to a one by deleting the zero. The intuitive magician at once
sees the true relations between creation and his individual body
and realizes that it is not without reason that he has ten fingers
and ten toes. The reader will, however, read more about this in
the third book of this trilogy "The Key to the True Quabbalah".
<br><br>The intuitive magician will also perceive a certain relation between
the earth-zone and the Muladhara Chakra but I will leave it
to him to meditate in this respect.
<br><br>3. Next to the zone girdling the earth comes the zone of the
Moon, with which the magician must become acquainted immediately
after the earth-zone.
<br><br>4. Beyond the Moon-zone lies the zone of Mercury and beyond
that zone follows
<br><br>5. the zone of Venus. If the magician has become sufficiently acquainted
with these zones he will have to learn
<br><br>6. about the zone of the Sun and later
<br><br>7. about the zone of Mars, then follows
<br><br>8. the zone of Jupiter, and at last
<br><br>9. the zone of Saturn.
<br><br>Many other zones lie beyond the last named, but it will be
enough for the magician to get to know the zones corresponding
to the planets, and be able to control them well.
The analogies and the hierarchy of each zone are dealt with in
the next chapter. Each sphere lying above the zone girdling the
earth, between the Moon and Saturn, has a threefold effect: firstly
on the mental, secondly on the astral and thirdly on the physical
world. Depending on the question in which sphere of the earthzone
a certain effect should be caused, the creation of the cause
for such an effect must be considered in that zone. Since the zones
mentioned above have certain individual influences on our earthzone
the magician operating with beings of such zones must have
a clear picture of the analogy of the laws of each zone regarding
his own microcosm and the microcosm of any other human being.
Each analogy of the zones to the micro- and macrocosm must
be quite clear to him and he must know how to create the cause
corresponding to the analogies with the help of the beings. In the
magician's conception each zone will not be a limited plane
beyond the earth-zone, but all zones run into one another in the
microcosm as well as in the macrocosm. The zones bear
astrological names, but do not have directly to do with the constructions
of the stars of the universe, although there exists some
relation between the stars and their constellations, enabling the
astrologers to draw their conclusions for mantic purposes or to
find out unfavourable influences. I have already given some hints
about the synthesis of astrology.
<br><br>Each zone is inhabited in just the same way as the earth-zone
already known to us. The beings of the zones have their special
commissions and are subject to the laws of their zone, as far as
causes and effects are concerned. In our opinion there exist
millions of beings in each zone. It is impossible to grade these
beings categorically. Each of these beings has reached a certain
degree in its spiritual development, a certain degree of maturity,
and a commission has been transferred upon it according to this
degree.
<br><br>A person without any magical development and without the
necessary maturity is not able to proceed beyond this material
world in order to get into contact with astral beings, not to mention
getting into contact with the beings of superior spheres.
<br><br>There are only a few people in our physical world, who, with
their spirit, are able to penetrate the borders of human existence
and to proceed to other zones. People who are able to do this consciously
are called initiates from the point of view of hermetics.
<br><br>An initiate is a selected person who, after many years of spiritual
development, reaches the degree of maturity necessary for his
commissions. A true initiate is not a philosopher who has reached
maturity by mere theoretical knowledge; he is a person who,
after constant strenuous training, has worked himself out of the
crowd of average persons and has gained his knowledge by practice.
Here the saying may well be applied: many are called, but
few are chosen. However, nobody need fear any imposed limitations,
and a diligent pupil of magic can reach perfection and
become an adept after conscientious training. Each human being
on this earth can reach the highest degree of perfection.
<br><br>As said above, only a few people will spiritually traverse the
common sphere of the zone girdling the earth to visit the sphere
next to it. These people are the leading heads in magic; they are
the initiators and teachers with the holy commission and duty to
help the individuals below them on their spiritual way. The same
is true, by universal laws, within the seven zones lying beyond the
earth-zone. There also exist few selected individuals among
millions of others living in those zones who, in their development,
have reached the necessary degree of perfection to be the leading
rulers or initiates there. Also the heads of the other zones have
their rank, dignity and title, just as the initiates in the zone girdling
the earth are honoured by the post of dignity corresponding
to their degree of maturity and their knowledge and take the rank
of barons, earls, knights, dukes, etc.
<br><br>The magician will realize that these names for ranks and titles
symbolise the degree of maturity of a being and certainly will not
regard them as earthly ranks. Therefore, only the leaders, the initiates
of the individual zones, are able to influence, with their
causes and effects, our spheres, no matter whether mental, astral
or physical. The way in which each individual being may influence
our world will be dealt with analogously step by step in a
further chapter on the hierarchy of the beings. Just the same as, in
our opinion, there exist in the earth-zone positive and negative,
that is good and evil beings, so is the situation the same in all
other zones. The good or positive powers and beings are generally
called angels or archangels, the negative ones demons or archdemons.
The same kind of hierarchy is to be found with the
negative beings: there are common demons, barons, counts, etc.
<br><br>The average person will have a conception of these beings corresponding
to his power of understanding. In his imagination angels
and archangels will have wings, demons and archdemons will
have horns. But the person well acquainted with the symbolism
will be able to interpret this conception according to true
hermetics. A magician knows that an angel has no wings in the
literal sense of the word and will see the analogy in these wings:
the wings are an analogy to the birds who move about freely in
the air above us. The wings are the symbol of what is superior to
us, the symbol of agility, liberty, freedom and at the same time
the principle of floating above us in the air, the element which is
lightest and penetrates everything. The negative beings or
demons are usually symbolized by animals with horns and tails,
or by creatures that are half human and half animal. Their symbolism,
on the contrary, stands for the opposite of what is good:
the inferior, incomplete, defective, etc. The question of whether
these beings, positive or negative, in their own spheres actually
have the shapes attributed to them by men, and meet each other
in these shapes, may be left undecided to the non-initiate. The
magician who is capable of visiting these zones by mental and
astral travelling and who is able to influence himself with the
vibration of these zones so that for the time of his stay he is like
an inhabitant of the respective sphere, will have found out that
this is not so. Without losing his individuality, he will find quite
different shapes there, which cannot be expressed by words. He
will not find personified beings and their leaders there, but
powers and vibrations that are analogous to the names and
qualities. If he tried to concretise, from his individual point of
view, one of these powers, or give it a shape according to his
power of understanding, that power would appear in to him in a
shape equivalent to his power of symbolic comprehension, no
matter whether positive power, alias angel, or negative power,
alias demon. A magician working with beings will make the beings
perform the causes in that zone in which he exercises his influence.
<br><br>The work of a quabbalist is different. The latter places
himself, with his spirit, into the zone in which a certain cause and
effect is intended. Though he, too, masters the laws of the zone,
he does not need the interposition of the beings for his purposes,
but does everything by himself with the help of the quabbalistic
word. There will be more about in my next work "The Key to
the True Quabbalah".
<br><br>The principles of the quabbalist's work are quite different. The
magician, however, in his present state of development, cannot,
for the time being, do otherwise than go on making use of beings
up to the point where he has reached a higher degree of development.
Each quabbalist must first have become a magician, in
order to be able to work differently and more advantageous by
later.
<br><br>If a magician calls a being whose shape he does not know into
the earth-zone or into our physical world from another zone,
then such a being, provided it wants to take on a visible shape at
all, must take on the shape appropriate to its qualities in order to
get into contact with the magician. A common demon, however,
is not able to do this, for a demon lacking the necessary maturity
is not capable of condensing itself from out of its sphere into the
earth-zone or our physical world. Therefore most books on
magic conjurations do not even mention simple demons, but talk
only of demons with a certain rank and title. But even these are
never dealt with in detail.
<br><br>In this connection, one may raise the question of whether a being
living in another zone would be able to call an initiate, a person
of spiritual rank, into its zone. Such a question has to be
denied from the hermetic point of view, for a human being, and
especially an initiate, is a God-like creature symbolising in
miniature, the macrocosm and representing the complete authority
in the microcosm and macrocosm. A magician can therefore
never be forced to do anything by any being, whatever degree of
perfection it might have, with only one exception: Divine Providence.
<br><br>All heads, no matter of what rank or from which zone
they come, and no matter whether good or evil, are only partial
aspects of the macrocosm, of God. Without permission of Divine
Providence no being is able to urge its will on the perfect magician
who has reached the connection with God. This again makes
obvious to the magician the true value of man, especially of the
man connected with God, and his significance within creation.
<br><br>If a being of another zone wishes to enter the earth-zone or our
physical world because Divine Providence has ordered it to do so
or because it is its personal desire, no matter whether in a mental,
astral or physical way, then such a being or head, irrelevant of its
rank, must take on the shape appropriate to the qualities of the
sphere from which it comes. An angel, for instance, who has love
as its main quality, will appear as a perfect beauty; a being whose
qualities are severity and strictness will have to appear in the
shape appropriate to these qualities. It is exactly the same with beings
of negative qualities: depending on the negative qualities they
represent, they will have to take on, when appearing in the earthzone
or on our physical earth, the shapes which symbolize these
qualities. The appearing shapes of these beings, no matter
whether good or evil or from whatever zone they come, will
enable the magician who is well acquainted with symbolism to
tell their qualities. The qualities of a being, its appearance and
symbolic representation, is fully appropriate to its name, and according
to the Law of Analogy, so that even a being of the highest
rank is not able to give itself a name unsuitable to its qualities.
<br><br>The magician, especially if acquainted with quabbalah, is capable
of thoroughly checking the analogies according to the law of
analogy and of determining whether the assertion of a being is
true or not. No being, not even the worst and most deceitful type,
will ever dare to tell the genuine magician a name which it does
not really possess, and it will never dare to appear in a shape other
than the one corresponding to its qualities. The genuine magician,
however, is naturally free to order the being who has appeared
in its true shape to change its shape into one desired by
him. He will always be obeyed by the being concerned, for the
genuine magician, as repeatedly stated before, is a perfect authority,
is a God-man.
<br><br>Each being, whether good or evil, whether angel or archangel,
demon or archdemon, from whatever zone it may come, has certain
restrictions in its qualities, caused and controlled by Divine
Providence, and depends on these qualities in its zone. A magician
will therefore do well in asking beings to fulfill only tasks
which they are able to fulfill due to their qualities and which lie
within the range of their zone. The magician must then know
well all qualities, faculties, causes and effects, powers and influences
of each individual zone, and have them under his control
in order to avoid making the mistake of asking a being to do
something outside of the range of its zone. If the magician does
not take this into consideration and if, in consequence, he asks a
being for something not lying iri its power, then the best such a
being can do is to place itself in another zone and there to cause
another being to fulfill the magician's will and desire. The actual
effect is, in this case, not brought about by the being evoked by
the magician, but by another being. The absolute will of the magician
is thus not directly expressed, as the effect takes place
without his knowledge. I shall give some more details on the
various shapes in which beings normally appear etc. in the
chapter on hierarchy.
<br><br>The magician might also be interested to learn how a being of
another zone is able to bring about the desired effect in our
physical world, be it mentally, astrally or physically. Since the
will and desire of the magician is analogous to the qualities of the
zones which he is dealing with, the commissioned being prepares
the causes necessary for the effect in the world of causes of its
own zone with the help of the electric and magnetic fluid, similar
to the procedure of volting, as described in "Initiation into
Hermetics", or directly by word-power (cosmic language) and
leads it through the world of causes of the relevant zone into the
world of causes of the earth-zone, condensed by imagination, and
from here, depending on the kind of effect it should cause, into
the mental, astral or physical sphere. This is the actual procedure
in respect of the beings capable of making their influence work
from their zone into our sphere. A spirit being, however, is not
able to do anything on its own accord or by its own will to influence
our sphere. Only the strict order of a magician given with
his absolute authority enables a being to influence our sphere effectively
from its zone; by doing so the being cannot be made
responsible for anything; every responsibility lies with the magician.
To make it yet clearer: the work done by a being is the same
kind of work which a servant does for his master.
<br><br>Of course, a true magician will never dare ask a being, especially
a negative being, to do things causing negative effects, for
although he has become the master of life and death, the master of
the laws, Divine Providence still controls him, and he would have
to atone immensely for evil deeds which he could not account
for.
<br><br>One might now ask why a magician uses an elemental, elementary,
astral or physical being mentally, astrally or physically, for
his operations in our world or sphere, or in another sphere, and
why he does not prefer to work with the power he has himself acquired
and so to cause the desired magical effect. He is, in fact,
able to cause certain effects when operating in the mental sphere
by elementals or volts, that is by electromagnetic fluids, and he is
also able to generate a certain physical power by various operations
with elementaries and to bring about in this way some
physical effect. The difference in the procedure lies in the fact
that the powers, beings, elementals, elementaries etc. generated
by him cannot operate independently, since they possess no intellect;
the beings of any other zone, however, are, because they
are intelligent creatures, able to carry out jobs for which a certain
degree of intelligence is necessary. In those cases where a magician
can do without any such being in obtaining his goal, he will
naturally desist from employing a being from another zone to
fulfill his purposes. He will, above all, evoke beings in case 1. he
wants do demonstrate his authority over the beings and 2. in
order to get full information on the zones from which the beings
come.
<br><br>Every experienced magician who leaves the physical world
either with his mental or with his astral body to visit the various
spheres of the earth-zone, or even to visit other zones, will realize
that the beings of all zones, irrespective of their qualities and
faculties, speak a universal language, called "metaphoricallanguage",
i. e. the language of imagination. This is the reason
why all beings can make themselves understood by another. Any
average person may moreover experience this the moment he
leaves his physical body, for he is then able to converse with any
person amongst the dead, no matter to which nation he may have
belonged before. If a magician whishes to say something in a
sphere lying outside our physical world, that is if he wants to
form ideas there, he will also do that by way of mouth, but no
sounds will come out of his mouth; in place of sound vibrations
pictures manifest themselves which then can be perceived by any
being.
<br><br>If, however, a spirit being is embodied in our physical world,
that is if it has left its zone to get adequately condensed in order
to be visible and audible, then this metaphorical language is at
once translated into the language the magician knows. This
means that should a magician call, by condensation, from the
earth-zone into the physical world, a person who before his death
was of Chinese, Indian or any other nationality, he will find that
such a spirit has a perfect command of the language the magician
himself speaks. A religious person will remember that the
apostles and disciples of Christ who, after the death of the
Saviour, were filled with the Holy Ghost, were able to speak in
all the languages of the earth. This expression of the Holy Bible
"filled with the Holy Ghost" clearly means that the apostles, the
disciples of Christ, were, by the enlightment of the Holy Ghost,
at that moment in the astral world and therefore able to translate
the metaphorical language into any other desired language. This
is no miracle, for it lies in the faculties of every being. Every person
who has some idea about hermetics will know that the
metaphorical language is the language of the universe, and that
the ancient peoples made abundant use of this metaphorical or
cosmic language. The hieroglyphs of the old Egyptians are a striking
example for this fact. That the words expressed by the
metaphorical language had a strong magic effect, cannot be
doubted. And it is not without purpose that the people of the
Orient and others made so much use of the metaphorical
language, for within the borders of their countries stood the
cradle of all hermetic sciences.
<br><br><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages of Evocational Magic<A name=advent></A></strong>
<br><br>Most people who get hold of a book on evocational magic are
misled, by various methods, to put at once into practice the
recommended procedure without having reached the necessary
degree of magic development. They think that the few incomplete
preparations recommended in the instructions will suffice.
The motives that lead to this kind of precipitate operation
usually have various causes. With one person it might be mere
curiosity, which makes him wonder whether other spheres really
do exist. Another person might be desirous of seeing spirits, beings
and demons, and yet another person might hope to put
himself into certain advantages by magical operations. A fourth
person perhaps wants to evoke beings to acquire from them certain
powers and faculties, to become famous and honoured, etc.
<br><br>Some people possibly intend to get certain information from certain
beings or to do harm to persons they do not like. Innumerable
motives which lead the inconsiderate to practise
magical evocation could be mentioned here. This chapter has
been written especially for these people for they should take to
their hearts these warning: Ignorance by no means prevents people
from danger and misfortune as a result of magical operations
should they be carried out without sufficient training and personal
development.
<br><br>If someone without proper magical development and preparation
dares to approach the practice of evocation, he can be sure of
either getting no results at all, which will probably cause him to
give up the whole matter, or he gets only incomplete results,
which can make him a complete unbeliever. Embittered by this,
he will say that everything is delusion without having tried to
find the causes of his lack of success within his own person, and
without becoming aware of the need to go deeper into the
knowledge of magical science if he wants to have success.
<br><br>It is quite the contrary with people who, either during their
present incarnation or during a previous incarnation, have reached
at least some degree of spiritual perfection and who have a certain
power of imagination. They will not be able to get perfect,
but perhaps partial results. These people are rigthly called
sorcerers or necromancers from the hermetic point of view. And
it is usually these people who fall into the hands of invisible
powers, as we can see from history. The most striking and best
known example is the tragedy of Doctor Faustus, popularised by
Goethe. I must desist here from describing the personality of
Doctor Faustus, but every magician will be able to explain what
happened in this case.
<br><br>Every genuine magician works with the beings consciously, he
is for them a person of certain authority, power and force, owing
to his magical development and maturity, his attitude towards the
spirit beings is quite different from the attitude of a sorcerer. A
magician's influence on a being, too, is quite different, and the
dangers to which a magician might be exposed are so small that
they need scarcely be mentioned. The magician is subject to only
a few temptations by the beings, but since he has achieved the
magical equilibrium, nothing can lead him off his way, not even
the most tempting projects. The beings acknowledge his authority
and regard him as their master, as the image of creation, the image
of God, and are quite willing to serve him without ever daring
to ask for any rewards for their services. It is different with a
necromancer or sorcerer, however, because of his inability to
create the necessary authoritative power towards the beings. He
is always in danger of losing his equilibrium at the cost of his individuality
and magical development.
<br><br>If a necromancer or sorcerer has a relatively high power of imagination
and is able partially to raise up his consciousness, it may
happen that, by using magic though barbarous names, he succeeds in having
one of his evocations translated into the language
of the being and the being he is evoking hears his voice. The next
question to arise is whether the being reacts to the evocation and
intends to do what the sorcerer wants him to do. For the being at
once realizes whether the sorcerer is mature enough and
developed enough to be able to exercise coercion or whether it
can go easily in opposition. If a positive, good being is involved,
it will pity the sorcerer. If the sorcerer has evoked an indifferent
and less active being and if the sorcerer's desire, if it were realised,
would not harm him, it might, now and then, give a token of
sympathy and do what the sorcerer wants done. But if the
sorcerer desires anything that might harm him or any other person
without being able to take the full responsibility for this,
then the being will not react to the sorcerer's evocation. All
means of coercion mentioned in various books for the sorcerer's
use in order to have the beings to work for him are ineffectual and
but mere phrases with only a slight or no effect at all on astral beings.
Negative beings, on the other hand, prefer to react to
negative and evil intentions and try to help the sorcerer in their
realization. But a head of demons also knows quite well that he
need not do what the sorcerer wants, if the sorcerer desires
something which would debit him too much karmically or which
he could not take responsibility for from the karmic point of
view. In such a case not even a demon would dare to fulfill the
sorcerer's wish, for this being, even though it be a negative one,
depends on Divine Providence. It cannot, on its own accord,
create vibrations which would cause a chaotic state in the harmony
of a sphere. Therefore it is necessary to point out again and
again that a certain degree of magical development and perfection
is absolutely necessary for the evocation of the beings of any
sphere and in order to be able to place one's consciousness into
the relevant sphere or zone and to translate one's thoughts into
the metaphorical language or cosmic language so that a being
understands them.
<br><br>With these points in mind the magician will realize the true
value of the book of charms which he has started for his personal
use, and that the book actually is a language book of the cosmic
language in which he will enter all the procedures of his art of
magical evocation translated into symbolic picture-language. A
necromancer or sorcerer working according to the worst rituals
and carrying out the most barbarous invocations and evocations
is by no means able to practise invocations in a systematic order,
that is, to start a conversation with the being concerned, not to
mention the authority he should be able to represent, for he is
lacking the necessary magical maturity and perfection. A
necromancer might, at the most, put himself into an ecstatic state
during his operations, which is not more than a cry into the zone
in question, even if his citations are most terrifying and appear to
him very promising.
<br><br>In most cases the sorcerer, during his state of ecstasy, is a victim
of the most misleading hallucinations. In the most favourable case
such an incomplete invocation of a sorcerer might, quite unconscious
to him, result in the creation of an elemental or an
elementary, owing to the ecstatic stress of the sorcerer's nerves,
depending on the amount of nerve-power he projects from his
magic circle into the magic triangle. Such an elementary might
then unconsciously take the shape of the evoked being; the
sorcerer, being unable to tell the difference, would regard the
elementary as the being evoked by him. Such an elementary is then
able to awaken certain desires in its creator and provide their
satisfaction. I have already said enough about this in my first
book: "Initiation into Hermetics".
<br><br>In this connection I must point out that the magician must have
a clear idea of what a contract is, how such a contract is made,
what are its disadvantages, etc. I shall now give further details on
this point.
<br><br>Should a sorcerer or necromancer succeed in actually calling the
head of a certain sphere into the physical world by the ecstatic
elevation of his spirit, such a head, if it is a negative one, will
always try to get under his influence not only the soul but also
the spirit of the sorcerer in order to make him fully dependent.
The sorcerer usually realizes during his second or third operation
that he is no longer able to get himself into the same state of
ecstasy which previously helped him to have a certain influence
on the concerned sphere. This is reason enough for a feeling of
uneasiness within him, which usually causes him literarily to
seize hold of the being appearing to him in order to have his
desires realized. The head now appearing to the sorcerer would
not at all react to him if he were not sure that the sorcerer's soul
and spirit were mature enough for him, and that therefore it pays
to try to get both. The head sees the many karmic developments
which the sorcerer may have undergone already and during
which he has reached a certain degree of intelligence and maturity,
and he is therefore certain that the sorcerer will render him
good service after his death. The being knows about all this
already in its own sphere, while watching the sorcerer carrying
out his operations. If it seems advantageous enough, a head, usually
a negative one, will appear to the sorcerer, and will try to get
the sorcerer for itself at any cost. Depending on the character of
the sorcerer, the being will apply the most variable methods,
knowing well the most vulnerable points where it can hit the
sorcerer. If, for instance, the sorcerer is anyhow fearful, the being will
try to frighten him in order to make him obey. If, however, the
sorcerer is somehow aware of his spiritual and psychic faculties,
the being will try to win him with all kinds of promises, for instance
with the promise that it will do anything, etc. But at the
same time it will point out that such a thing is not possible
without a mutual agreement and will point out the advantages
of such a contract. It is then up to the sorcerer to resist the
temptations of the being and to oppose it. A fight within the
sorcerer's own conscience will start and will develop into a terrible
one, for the conscience of a man is the most subtle form of the
Divine Providence. If, however, the sorcerer is not willing to
listen to the divine warnings, that is to follow his conscience, but
supresses it in spite of its repeated appearance, then he becomes a
victim of the being by making an agreement or a contract with it.
<br><br>This theme will certainly interest everybody. Therefore I will
examine it more closely from the hermetic angle. Why does a
spirit being want to get possession of the soul and spirit of a
sorcerer? There are several reasons for this. Firstly, no being, least
of all a negative one, will ever do anything for the sorcerer
without the hope of getting a relevant reward. The sorcerer is
forced by contract to leave the earth-zone after he has cast away
his physical body. He is indeed taken away by the devil, as
legends state, and must travel to the sphere of that being with
which he has made the contract in order to serve there as its servant.
<br><br>The head, with whom the contract has been made, usually
employs a deceased sorcerer as a messenger to the astral, mental
or physical sphere of the earth-zone where he has to carry out
commissions for his master, corresponding to the negative sphere
of that being. Such a head likes to get into connection with a
sorcerer because the latter has been created as the image of God
and therefore has four poles and consequently many more
possibilities than the being itself. In most cases the head's servant,
in this case a human being, is made into a spiritus familiaris or factotum
and put at the disposal of other similar sorcerers. In the
function of a spiritus familiaris the sorcerer then is given all the
power the head itself possesses, since from that moment he is
deputizing for the being. The transfer of power upon the sorcerer
is effected either by an Ankhur from the head or the principal of
demons or by influencing him with zone power so that he can
either bring about the ordered effects by himself and secure the
results wanted, or he is supplied with other servants to help him
carry out his commissions. But whether such servants are true inhabitants
of the zone and, as such, mere subordinates of their
masters, or whether they really are victims as described above, is
difficult to determine, for such beings are not allowed to tell
anybody anything about themselves. It is also possible that unwanted
phases in the memory or consciousness of such spirits
have been deleted, either by a magic spell or other practices. And
so the sorcerer, in spite of the qualities he has on account of his
four-pole nature, becomes dependent on the head's sphere, that is
on his master's sphere, and that prevents him from freeing
himself of the ties with his head and from living his own life. He
becomes a will-less instrument of the head and must do
everything the latter wants.
<br><br>After having sealed the contract or pact the sorcerer cannot do
any work for weeks or months. During this time he is taught by
his head various practices and is initiated into the use of his
powers. The sealing of such a pact is actually not much different
from what is stated in the grimoires or magic books. There is,
however, a little difference hardly known to anybody: the pact
itself is not compiled by the spirit being, but is, in fact, drawn up
and written by the sorcerer himself, like the book of charms. The
text of the pact is written down in ordinary ink. Special ink,
however, may be used for this purpose, depending on the rituals
applied, but this is not so important. The contract clearly states
what services have to be rendered by the being which wishes it
will fulfill, which possibilities are given the sorcerer with this
pact, including other conditions which must be fulfilled by the
being on behalf of the sorcerer. On another page of the contract
the duties are laid down which, on the one hand, the sorcerer
must carry out for the being and which, on the other hand, the
being orders itself to carry out. It further states in which manner
the head can be called and whether it has to appear visibly or invisibly;
how servants, put at the sorcerer's disposal, have to be
treated, etc. The most important point is the period for which the
contract is valid and that after the expiration date of the contract
the sorcerer is obliged to travel to the sphere of the demon. Also
the way in which the sorcerer will die in the physical world and
how he will move over into the sphere of the head is fixed by contract.
All points and conditioned are agreed to by both parties,
and the being usually signs the contract by its own seal, using the
sorcerer's hand as a medium, and the mutual agreement is
countersigned. It is also quite possible that the being asks for, or
insists on, the sorcerer's signing the contract with his own blood.
But contracts have been made, and are still being made, without
such a condition. Usually the contract is written in duplicate; one
copy remains in the sorcerer's hands, the other is for the being. It
is stated in the books that the being takes both copies, but this is
done rarely and only happens with a certain category of beings.
Usually the second copy is folded together by the sorcerer, and
burned. This burning of the contract actually means that the ideas
and points of the contract are transmitted to the relevant zone.
<br><br>In this, or in a similar manner, with which there may be little
differences which are not essential at all, pacts are sealed, especially
pacts with negative beings. Such a pact can neither be broken
by the sorcerer nor by the being and must be adhered to unconditionally.
It often happens that the victim does not even know that
he has made such a horrible contract and comes to the respective
sphere without knowing that he has to payoff the duties the being
has rendered him on earth. If, however, bad conscience starts
working on the mind of a sorcerer before the contract expires,
and if, in consequence, the sorcerer tries to free himself by any
means, then the being will try anything to harm the sorcerer and
to destroy him. Many witchcraft trials of the past are the unmistakeable
proof of this and sorcerers who felt sorry for their
sealing of such contracts and who therefore tried out all means
and ways to free themselves have had to atone heavily for their
breach of contract at the instigation of the beings concerned.
Many sorcerers of ancient times were not able to evade the
funeral pyre only because the idea and divine spark won inside
them and made them prefer death instead of remaining in contact
with a demon till the expiration of the contract. But sorcerers
who strictly adhered to the points of the contract and fulfilled
every duty till the period expired always remained under the protection
of the dark powers and no power in the world could ever
harm them. Those who did not adhere to the contract and regretted
their mistake were severely persecuted by the beings, for the
latter always found means and ways to harm their former proteges.
<br><br>The kind of contracts described above may be regarded as the
usual type, for the sorcerer tries to get into contact with a being
by means of the magic of evocation and to maintain this connection
with the being either directly or by the spiritus familiaris serving
the being.
<br><br>The reader may now ask whether such a sorcerer is condemned
to be the servant of a being or head forever. Answering such a
question presents no difficulty to a magician who is equally acquainted
with all spheres. As soon as the sorcerer has re-paid the
head in full measure for its duties on earth - this can take, in our
chronology, many hundreds of years, since time and space are absent
in the spheres - the sorcerer's conscience will start working
on him more and more and his four-pole nature feels himself little
by little free from the bondage. When the sorcerer has paid back
every penny of his debt, he can again do what he likes. But if, at
that point, he still stifles his conscience, unwilling to follow it, he
will remain in the sphere of his head and will, eventually, lose his
four-polarity and identify himself with the plane in which he
lives by taking on the vibration of that plane forever. By this way
he will condemn himself. The sorcerer then ceases to be a human
being, the image of God, and becomes a being of that sphere, that
is, he sinks down to a demon. This certainly is the most regrettable
state a human being can get into and may be called damnation
from the religious point of view, or as true sin against the
Holy Ghost.
<br><br>This would be the complete procedure for the sealing of a contract
between a sorcerer and a being of another zone. Should
the sorcerer follow the voice of his conscience he will be able to
leave the zone of the head and find a new home in the earth-zone.
Here he can again live as a four-pole being and renew his spiritual
development. If, in this case, it is necessary for him to return into
our physical world, this rebirth will be granted him without
any difficulties for in the physical world it is far easier to become
purified and to work on one's magical development like other beings.
<br><br>A reincarnated sorcerer is then able to acquire, in our world,
great magic power, since he has experience in working with
negative powers. Such re-born sorcerers are the born magicians,
for they possess inborn magical faculties and do not need to accumulate
much knowledge or to undergo a special training in
magic. It cannot be denied, however that it could again happen
that such a person is overcome by the temptation to misuse these
powers and that the same head of spirits may approach him anew,
possibly under a different mask, to regain his previous victim
with the same intention of taking him again to his sphere after his
physical death. Such a sorcerer, however, has a much freer will on
this earth and can therefore resist such temptations much better.
His conscience, too, works much better and will warn him more
forcefully than does the conscience of a human being with no
such personal career. Thus it seldom happens that a sorcerer falls
in a second time. Usually he is so purified by his experience that
he walks along the true path of magic and is less inclined to take
up contacts with demons or negative spirits.
<br><br>This statement of true facts may be a warning to all truth seeking
people not to follow the path of sorcery, for one can see from
what has been said above that such a step is a great regression in
the spiritual evolution and development of a human being. That
all I have said is no fantastically made up story but a sad, true fact
that can be checked by any true magician. The incarnated
sorcerer proceeding along the right path of initiation is exposed
to a far greater number of temptations than an average human being
who is starting his spiritual development from the beginning.
The planes which formerly bound him try time after time in the
most refined manner to get their previous victim again under
their control.
<br><br>In this work I do not intend to name anybody from ancient or
modern times who has sealed contracts with beings, but besides
the cases generally known to the public, like Doctor Faustus and
Urban-Grandier, there are numerous others of whom the public
has never heard.
<br><br>There is yet another way to seal contracts, known to only a few
initiates. This should be a warning to all those who try to get into
contact with various kinds of beings. This pact is not handled
directly, but by the help of a human body already existing. Which
of the two ways to seal contracts is the more advantageous
depends on the view of the individual magician. The less known
way may be prefered by deceased people as well as by other beings
of the earth-zone, even by beings of higher zones.
<br><br>The getting into contact through a human being requires the
human being's control of the elements, the light- and the Akashaprinciple
and a higher intelligence and magical maturity on the
side of the spirit being which wants to get into contact with, and
make a contract with the human being. From the hermetic point
of view such a contract is quite possible and is practised by a
number of sorcerers without their differing from the average people by
anything strange or unnatural. Only the well trained clairvoyant
and the eyes of a genuine magician are able to distinguish
such a pact. The sorcerer is usually invited to such a contract by a
being and he is not seldom offered such a pact by beings of the
elements, which live next to the earth.
<br><br>If all conditions are fulfilled the making of such a contract
presents no difficulty. The method rests on the following procedure:
The being looks for a physical body anywhere in the
material world at the moment of its dying. A healthy body is
prefered in this case, a body which dies of little cause such as for
instance during an accident. Also bodies dyding from the consequences
of an inflammation of the lungs, of encephalitis, heart
failure etc. may serve this purpose. On the other hand, bodies are
not welcome which have been destroyed by tuberculosis or other
infectious diseases of vital organs and in which the destruction of
such organs have been the cause for the person's physical death.
<br><br>The restoration of the harmony in a body destroyed by such
diseases would take much effort. At the moment the linking
thread between body, soul and spirit rends and the life-matrix is
interrupted, the being gets hold of the human body and is able to
build up a new thread between itself and the human body by doing
what I have already described in "Initiation into Hermetics",
that is by employing the light fluid. It is quite clear that the being
- before uniting itself with the physical body - must form its
astral body according to the shape and size of the human body
concerned, using for this purpose the matter of the elements, in
order to get into a harmonious unity of the two lifethreads: the
mental and astral matrix.
<br><br>The being who has taken possession of a human body in the
described way becomes itself a human being in a borrowed body.
The relatives and onlookers form the opinion that the dying person
after having been in agony has come to life again as if by
miracle and finally recovered from the disease. This is how the
relatives and those persons, who are not able to observe by clairvoyance
the leaving of the astral body from the physical body,
look on the event. Since the being possesses a miraculous degree
of adaptibility and maintains all faculties and powers of the astral
world and since it knows everything, it continues playing the role
of the person who actually died, but it will try to disappear from
the surroundings of the relatives of the deceased person and to get
into contact with the sorcerer without attracting attention. The
being keeps all its abilities of its former sphere in the new body
and puts itself at the disposal of the sorcerer. With the exception
of a true magician nobody will ever find out the true facts and
nobody will find anything suspicious in two friends or a boy
friend and girl friend meeting each other, and the people around
the two will never find out about the true relations of the two.
The services which the being may render the sorcerer during his
physical existence are exactly the same as if the sorcerer had got
into contact with another being of that sphere. If the sorcerer
wants to have his influence work on the astral or mental world
via this being, then the latter puts itself into a state of trance und
so can fulfill the sorcerer's wishes.
<br><br>The question of carnal contact is usually discussed at the moment
of the first citation or meeting with the sorcerer and the
sorcerer is well informed about the whole procedure. That the
sorcerer must never say a word to anybody about the matter is
only too clear, for otherwise he would have to pay with his life
for his communicativeness.
<br><br>Sorcerers have often instigated mermaids to get hold of the
bodies of beautiful girls of this world in the above mentioned
manner in order to get into carnal contact with these undines,
and have even married such beings. There was then no difference
between a normal female and an incarnated undine, for the latter,
in its carnal body, was subject to the same laws as all other human
beings. It kept, however, the faculties and powers of the waterelement
and made use of them in its human incarnation. The incarnated
undine could also have children. But the most tragic fact
about the matter was that she wanted the sorcerer to be absolutely
loyal since she maintained a contact between her own physical
body and the sorcerer's physical body. If the sorcerer wanted to
have sexual intercourse with another woman he was in danger of
having to atone for this with his life. In such a case the undine was
also no longer able to remain in the physical world and was not
able to get into further contacts. Soon after the death of the
sorcerer who had become her lover or husband she also died.
After her death such a undine does not travel to the earth-zone
like any other human being, but has to return to the water element
and again lives there as undine.
<br><br>If a magician with a high degree of perfection and relationship
to God would bring about such a procedure he would by his
creative power, be able to build up, with the undine, the same
kind of harmony of the elements as it possesses any human being.
He would be able to create a new human being whose spirit
would be as immortal as the spirit of any other human creature.
However, a true magician will never undertake such operations
without having sufficient reasons. I only mention this here
because I want to show that such a thing lies within the faculties
of a magician. The non-initiate may believe this to be an incredible
fairy tale, but, from the hermetic point of view, such things
are quite possible and can easily be realized. The true magician
will not have any doubts of these possiblities.
<br><br>Apart from spiritism there is another kind of evocation of
spirits called necromancy. The difference between a sorcerer and
a necromancer is the following: the sorcerer usually tries to get into
contact with higher beings of the earth-zone, with the heads of
the elements or with the heads of other zones; the necromancer,
on the other hand, merely practices the evocation of deceased persons.
The method of necromancy is quite simple and a magician
who has not yet reached perfection is able to apply this method
with more success than a sorcerer practicing evocations. A
necromancer faces the same kind of dangers as the sorcerer since a
deceased human being may also take full possession of the
necromancer and make him completely dependent. If a
necromancer becomes so dependent on an astral being that he
cannot do anything without the advice and help of the being, then
we may also talk of a sort of pact in this case, though this kind of
contract may not have the same tragical consequences as the pacts
dealt with before.
<br><br>The magician is able to call any being from the astral world
without any danger, without becoming dependent on it and
without becoming a victim of necromancy. A necromancer is a
person with a low degree of spiritual and magical development,
whose main object is to get into contact with astral beings of the
earth-zone, preferably with dead people. The necromancer will in
most cases try to make use of a being from the astral sphere, that
is he will either require of such a being certain magical duties in
the physical, astral or mental plane or merely try to satisfy his
curiosity. For this purpose the necromancer will choose a human
being after his physical death who during his life on earth busied
himself with any of the secret sciences and who possibly has
reached a certain degree of perfection in this. If such a person happens
to be a true magician who has followed the true path of initiation
and has learned all its laws here on earth, having thus acquired
a certain degree of perfection, who noble-minded strove
for positive aims and controlled the negative powers, he will, if he
thinks it beneficial, appear to the necromancer and point out to
him the advantages or disadvantages of his projects and intentions.
<br><br>A true magician will, however, never keep up a constant
connection with a necromancer, nor will he try to influence the
necromancer in such a manner that he becomes dependent on
him. He will always be prepared to warn the necromancer and
will give him permission to call him in case of emergency. Furthermore,
he will give good advice to the necromancer and initiate
him into the laws of the astral sphere, but he will never be
prepared to serve the necromancer, or to do whatever he wants,
or to fulfill his material desires. Only bad magicians with little experience
and an affection for negative powers or mere sorcery
will try to maintain a contact with a necromancer or assist him in
realizing his desires and to satisfying his curiosity. If the
necromancer gets into the sphere and under the control of such a
being, he will acquire the same kind of vibration as that being has
in the earth-zone and thus becomes a fellow-sufferer. The astral
being will then prevent the necromancer from making any progress
in his spiritual and magical development and will see
that he is never enlightened or blessed with personal advance. The
being will then be full of malicious pleasure because it has succeeded
in being troublesome to a human being on earth. It
remembers the days of its own life on earth, its difficulties and
troubles there, the temptations it could not resist, the powers it
misused and the lack of chances for its true initiation, and it will
also try to hinder the necromancer in his development. The
danger that arises for the necromancer in such a case need not be
analysed. I will, however, mention the fact that the necromancer
may easily be vampirised by such a being and that the being will
try to realize in the astral world its own egocentric plans by help
of the vampirised powers of the necromancer.
<br><br>Therefore every scholar is warned not to take up any such contacts
and not to make himself dependent on any being. The manner
in which a necromancer calls a being from the astral plane
rests on two methods. One method is spiritistic: the being is asked
to reveal itself by help of mediums; that is by mediumistic
writing or by mediums put into a state of trance. This method requires
great perseverance until the being is able to take up a direct
contact and to appear to the necromancer. The other method is
that of evocation: the necromancer takes up contact with the being
by help of a picture of the spirit's previous incarnation or by
enlivening such a picture until finally the being steps out of it like
an elementary, taking on its previous shape. A necromancer does
not usually succeed at once, but if he goes on with his work persistently
he might, depending on his maturity, development, willpower
and imagination, force the being to appear to him visibly.
<br><br>A necromancer can hardly differentiatewhether, in such a case,
his power of imagination plays the main role, or if he has created
an elementary, or if the visible connection with the being has in
fact taken place. But a narrow-minded necromancer does not care
who has brought about the connection or what has actually caused
the disired effect, if it has been his power of imagination (phantasy),
or if repeated stressing of his nerves has created an elementary
or if the being evoked really has appeared from the astral
world.
<br><br>Should the necromancer have a predeliction for negative
powers, his evocation and his endeavours to cause a projection in
the astral world will possibly be readily answered by a so-called
black-magician who will himself try to get into contact with such
a necromancer. All of the necromancer's appetite for instructions,
practices, satisfying of his curiosity, fulfillment of his
desires, will then be quenched by that being. The necromancer is
responsible for all that happens and he will thus charge his Karma
to his account, especially if he wants to see desires realized which
he can in no way justify. That the end of such a necromancer cannot
be other than tragic need not be stressed. Necromancers
usually die an unnatural death or suddenly of an incurable disease.
I should also mention the fact that there is also possible a
passive relationship with beings of the astral plane and with beings
of higher zones. This passive intercourse, however, is not so
effective and does not give such great magical results as the practice
of evocation. Also in this case an unexpected pact could be
the final outcome, and the person taking up the connection by
this passive intercourse is sometimes even worse off than the
sorcerer or necromancer, since he has no control at allover the
being with which he has taken up connection, or over the effects
caused by it.
<br><br>There are two principle kinds of this passive intercourse: the
first is a spiritistic one: the spiritist himself is the medium for the
contact and intercourse with the being, either by medial clairvoyance,
clairaudience, automatic writing etc; the second
possibility for passive intercourse is that a hypnotist or a
mesmerist takes up the connection with the being by means of a
somnambulant medium and maintains the contact continously,
for satisfaction of his curiosity or for certain tasks in the mentel,
astral or physical worlds. If the hypnotist or spiritist has not
undergone any magic training and if, therefore, has not the
necessary degree of magical development and maturity, the health
of the medium is endangered in both cases. Many mediums and
spiritists who have been in constant connection with a single being
and have often made use of it, so that they finally became
dependent on that being - which actually results in an indirect
pact - have had to pay for it with severe diseases of the mental,
astral and physical body. Many a lunatic asylum could bear
witness for such deplorable cases.
<br><br>All I have said above especially applies to the work of sorcerers
and necromancers with negative powers and the dangers involved.
In this connection I should like to point out that the genuine
magician, who having come along the path of true development
tries to get into contact with positive beings irrespective of their
rank or zone, should not become dependent even on good beings
or intelligences. He may if he likes, get into touch with a good being
any time he wishes, but he should not join any being even if
he is especially attracted by it, for if he does, a pact could also be
the result, similar to such with negative beings, though the
dangers for a genuine magician operating with positive beings
could never be so great nor so tragic.
<br><br>There also exist methods and instructions for the making of
contracts with genii of any zone, who, due to such a contract,
may advise and assist the magician in any respect. Of course a genuine
magician will, during the course of his development, try to
get into touch with good beings, since this is no doubt necessary,
but he must not make himself dependent on any single being, no
matter whether angel or superior intelligence. By becoming
dependent on a good being a magician would take up, like a
sorcerer, the vibration of the sphere from which the good being
has come and, by and by, would influence himself so strongly
with this vibration that finally he would take on the complete
nature of that being. Such a being, however, will of course not be
interested in a written contract.
<br><br>There are also methods for the conclusion of the same kind of
written contract or pact between a magician and a superior
positive intelligence. This contract concluding, the magician can
be sure that the being will protect him in any respect; that it will
help him, warn him and do every kind of good service for him;
but after the death of the magician the being will automatically
draw him to its own sphere. In that zone the magician will not
have to serve the guardian angel by force, but freely. Since such a
magician is in constant connection with good beings he will
become part of that plane and will lose any interest in climbing
any higher or in travelling to another zone. He will be content
with his life and his evolutionary rise is temporarily interrupted.
<br><br>If a magician is sent by Divine Providence to the earth-zone or
into our physical world to fulfill a certain task as a human being,
he starts longing for a sphere set above him. Should a magician,
after having been allied to a genius in a certain zone, be incarnated
in our physical world, then such a former alliance becomes obvious
by the magician's special ability either in the field of
hermetic science or in any other cultural field such as art,
literature etc. This shows that the procedure is the same, no matter
whether it is a positive or negative one, and a genuine magician
will never be hindered in his development by any pact with a
genius or an angel, but will advance in his development unimpeded.
By an equal affection for all beings the magician will always
remain conscious of his desire to become a perfect human being,
created as the true image of God, and true divinity will be
reflected in him. He is not influenced by any sphere, therefore he
can reach true perfection, providing that no one element is
prevailing within him and that he has been able to develop within
himself the absolute equilibrium of all forces and powers and to
maintain the standard of this development in future.
<br><br>The higher spheres are the place where it is decided whether a
magician is willing to reach the highest perfection possible or
likes to become a saint. A magician desirous of the highest degree
of perfection may become the greatest and highest lord of creation,
for he fully symbolises the true and complete image of God
in all his aspects. A saint, however, remains under one aspect only
and reaches perfection therein. He becomes a part of that aspect,
and finally, when he has reached perfection in this aspect, he loses
his individuality. The highest degree of perfection that man is
ever able to reach is that of becoming a true sovereign, a true
magician, thus actually representing a true and complete image of
God, whereby he never loses or is forced to give up his individuality.
By the knowledge of the hierarchy of the beings, of their zones,
their causes and effects, the true magician is able to rule over any
being of creation, no matter whether good or evil, as this is actually
his true commission. Ruling over the spirit beings does not
necessarily mean ruling by force, for the beings, good or evil, will
always be prepared to serve the magician, to complete his will and
to fulfill any of his desires without asking for anything in return.
The heads of zones also like to serve a magician, and if the magician
desires it they will even put at his disposal the beings serving
them, and will provide him with the necessary ankhur without
ever daring to ask the magician to conclude a contract with the
relevant zone. The genuine magician is free to put under his will
as many serving genii as he likes, from any sphere he likes; they
will all have to serve him as their highest master, or their
sovereign. The genuine magician with a noble character will
make no difference between a positive or a negative being, for
Divine Providence has not created anything unclean. He is quite
aware of the fact that demons are as necessary as angels, for
without these contradictions a differentiating hierarchy would
not be possible. His respect for a being, whether positive or
negative, will depend on the being's rank. He himself will take
the golden path of the middle way, the path of true perfection.
<br><br><strong>The Spiritus Familiaris or Serving Spirits<A name=spiritus></A></strong>
<br><br>Most grimoires and other books dealing with the magic of evocation
often talk of serving spirits, the so-called spiritus familiaris.
According to these books serving spirits are put at the magician's
personal disposal by high beings, especially by the principals of
demQns with the idea that the magician need not bother personally
with the principals of demons, that is their masters, on each occasion
and for every trivial matter. The books further state that
such serving spirits usually are delivered to the magician, or, as is
more likely, to the sorcerer by that head or principal of demons
with whom he has concluded a contract. By means of an ankhur
the serving spirit is provided by its head with the same kind of
force, power and faculties etc. that the head possesses. The magician
does not care by whom the effect he wants is caused;
whether it is by the head himself or by any of the spirits serving
him. One thing, however, is important: the Karmic responsibility
always lies with the magician, or with the sorcerer. As already
mentioned in the chapter dealing with the various kinds of contracts,
the magician must, after the contract has expired in the
physical world, follow the principal of demons into his sphere
and there pay back in full measure for the work done by it. This
repayment, of course, is not a material repayment, but a spiritual
one.
<br><br>From the hermetic point of view, the serving spirit must not be
taken for the so-called family spirits of the primitive peoples of
antiquity. These family spirits were, in most cases, the deceased of
a tribe, its ancestors and pre-ancestors, heroes etc. with whom a
type of necromancy was practised similar to a more primitive
kind of fetish-worsphip by keeping up a permanent contact with
these deceased. This kind of necromancy may be compared with
the spiritism of our own days. Since every initiate knows about
the practices, cult operation etc. necessary for getting into contact
with an ancestor, with a family spirit, I will desist from writing
again about this matter. Not only had each family their family or
house ghost; there were also numerous tribes having their own
genius, as is known from history. The true magician is able to tell
the difference, from the hermetic standpoint, between an actual
spiritus familiaris and a family or ancestral spirit.
<br><br>The attitude a genuine magician takes towards getting into contact
with a head, i. e. a higher being, a higher intelligence, is quite
different to that of a sorcerer or black-magician. The latter wants
to get beings under his power without any special effort and
without the appropriate preparatory operations and magical
development, in order to make these being serve him and help
him to realize all his desires. Unfortunately, a sorcerer is likely to
forget that by doing so he is debiting his Karma and that he is doing
this at the costs of his evolution, and above all, to the costs of
his magical development. Beings serving a sorcerer never work
without reward. From the material point of view such services
may only be regarded as loans. Actually, the sorcerer becomes the
slave of the relevant being, for after their contract has expired, the
sorcerer must, as already pointed 'out before, pay back
everything. The beings are fully aware of this fact, and their devotion
towards the magician, which is to ensure him that they are
always willing to serve him and to fulfill any of his desires, often
delude a sorcerer to the erroneous opinion that he has become
master over the beings. His desires, his claims towards these beings
increase during the course of the alliance, and the sorcerer
eventually develops into a glutton. Only shortly before the expiration
date of the contract, the sorcerer realizes what he has
done and what Karmic responsibilities he has taken upon his
shoulders. But at that point it is usually too late, and all advice
and instructions to shake off the bondages of such a contract are,
from the hermetic point of view, useless and impracticable, andin
the eyes of a true magician - sheer ridiculous. Negative effects
that have once been set at work, no matter in which way, must,
due to the law of cause and effect, have their due clear off and adjustment.
One might oppose that Divine Providence, in its aspects of love
and charity, could, in some cases, make an exception.
<br><br>However, the genuine magician knows that causes are always followed up
by the relevant effects, otherwise the Law of Karma, the law of
retaliation, the rule of law of the whole universe, would be untrue,
that is illusory. That this is not so, but that, on the contrary,
everything takes place due to the most genuine laws with a most
admirable precision need not be stressed here. Divine love and
charity with all their other aspects such as benevolence etc. work
up to the point where man realizes that he himself is the cause of
the sorrows that have overcome him, and this knowledge enables
him to carry his burden more easily. From the correct universal
point of view Providence, in its aspects of love, benevolence etc.,
cannot further intervene. Every experienced magician, knowing
the universal laws, finds this in order. Every genuine magician
should therefore take heed not to conclude a contract which
would entirely halt his personal magical development and evolution.
A true initiate will not even be tempted to conclude contacts
with high and good heads, no matter how great the advantages
might be. To bind oneself to spirit beings and their spheres means
losing the freedom of one's own thoughts and doings.
<br><br>Why then, one might ask, is it necessary to deal with the magic
of evocation; is it not better to work for one's personal development
and to leave the beings where they are? The answer to this
question is that the genuine magician may, if he likes, get into
contact with any beings, positive ones or negative ones, and that
he should even regard it as his duty to practise the true magic of
evocation, but he must never be tempted to bind himself to any
being. He can use his connections to enlarge his knowledge about
the various spheres, to learn about the laws of such spheres, and
to demonstrate his magical authority to those beings with which
he operates during his evocations. No doubt, such beings will not
only be prepared to give him any information he wants, but they
will be quite pleased to serve him, for to them the genuine magician
is their master, is the true initiate to whom they owe obedience
and loyalty. They would not even dare to approach a genuine
magician, who has been truly initiated into magic and has
therefore reached perfection in it, with a contract in mind. The
magician may, if he thinks it necessary, employ serving spirits
from one sphere or the other, but he knows quite well that he
does not owe them anything, for anything that a being might be
doing for him he can do out of his own powers as the result of his
systematic magical development. The magician may employ beings
firstly to help his fellow men, not himself, and secondly to
use the valuable time saved for his own development. This is the
right attitude to take and it cannot be compared with the attitude
of a sorcerer, as one can easily see. The magician need not practise
the magic of evocation all the time, but he must be able to carry
out successfully such practices whenever it should be necessary.
Exact knowledge of the true magic of evocation will increase his
wisdom, will increase his power over beings of the universe, and,
in this manner, strengthen his magic authority. A true magician
must therefore be perfect in every respect. During his magical
evocations he will pay attention to the exact hierarchy of the beings
and will:
<br><br>1. get into contact with the heads of the elements and their beings;
if necessary, also with their serving spirits, their subjects
<br>2. have regard to the earth-zone with all its heads and subjects
<br>3. change over to the beings of the Moon according to the
hierarchy
<br>4. have regard to the heads of the zone of Mercury
<br>5. then he will pay his attention to the Venus-zone
<br>6. the Sun-zone
<br>7. the Mars-zone
<br>8. the Jupiter-zone
<br>9. the zone of Saturn.
<br><br><strong>Magical Evocation<A name=evoc></A></strong>
<br><br>If the magician takes into his hands a book on evocation, or if he
has, in his library, several books dealing with this subject, he will
find a certain connection between all the instructions, and if he
takes them all together he will be informed how to call a being
and which formulae have to be used for that purpose etc. In none of
the books, however, will he find the actual pre-conditions for a
successful evocation. Therefore it is not at all surprising that nearly
all attempts go wrong. From the hermetic point of view any
contact with a spirit being of a certain sphere may be regarded as a
sort of evocation, irrespective of the fact whether spiritistic
methods, methods of necromancy or any other methods are applied
for establishing such a contact. The question of whether the
desired being actually appears on account of the various methods
applied remains unanswered, for only the person who tries them
could give a true statement about it. If sometimes such an attempt
made according to the methods laid down in those books leads to
a success, it is still undecided, whether the results have come out
because of the method, for other practices could also have played
a decisive part.
<br><br>For instance, in the case of spiritistic evocations,
success can be brought about by some quite different factors, even
if a great amount of evidences is available indicating that the success
is the result of the method of evocation suggested. The subconsciousness
of the oral medium may be the cause for the
spiritistic success, if it is a success at all. Furthermore, the subconscious
creation of phantoms, elementals, elementaries, which
the operator's increased attention and power of imagination
might have created during the evocation, can in such a case, not
be attributed to the being but to the operator's own individuality.
This fact is hardly ever acknowledged by the person concerned.
I shall give - from the hermetic point of view - a full description
of everything absolutely necessary for a successful evocation,
i. e. the actual magical connection with beings of any sphere. Above
all, the magician or the person intending to busy himself with
magical evocation should know that without the development of
one's astral senses, especially those of clairvoyance and clairaudience,
a successful evocation cannot be thought of. It would be
the same as if a blind man wanted to follow an unknown street
without a guide. Clairvoyance and clairaudience is the first condition
for consciously getting into contact with a being by the help
of active magic. If the magician does not care for this condition,
or if a person dares to try an evocation without having his astral
senses trained accordingly, he can be sure that he will, like all
other operators, be disappointed and have no success at all. At the
same time he is in danger of being degraded to a necromancer or
sorcerer if, during an exalted state, he should have any partial success
of whatever sort, regardless of the fact that his plans and intentions
rest on good motives.
<br><br>The magician must, under all conditions, be able to make use of
his astral senses during his operation, because then he is able to
control exactly the whole procedure and is not in danger of being
deceived or of working without success. A magician whose astral
senses are well developed knows at once whether the being involved
is merely a creation of imagination or whether it is the being
he wanted to appear from a certain sphere. An evocation,
from the hermetic point of view, is therefore the conscious getting
into contact with a certain being, not effected by passive intercourse
- as described in "Initiation into Hermetics" in the
chapter dealing with the conscious passive connection with beings
- the magician being used as a medium, but outside of his
body.
<br><br>The being or power of any sphere which is to be evoked outside
the body of the magician, may either be called into the magic
triangle, or the magic mirror, or onto a material impregnated
with a fluid condenser to be condensed there. At the beginning
the magician will not be able to do without the magic implements.
<br><br>Later, as soon as he has enough experience and as soon
as he has a certain sphere under his complete control, i. e. as
soon as the beings of that sphere are fully under his power, pay
him obedience and loyalty and, by that, acknowledge his magical
authority, he can do without magical aids. The experienced magician
then is in the position to call any being of the sphere he has
under his power and to work with it, without using magical aids.
He can call a being to any place at any time, how and when he
wishes to do so, without the aid of the circle or triangle and
without any special preparations. A beginner, on the other hand,
must necessarily use magic aids, for they are a support for his consciousness
and are therefore necessary for a successful evocation.
<br><br>If the magician has complete control over a sphere without having
to use any magical weapons, he advances to the next higher
sphere and again makes use of his magical aids until he also controls
that sphere completely. The magician must always bear
three principles in mind when he wants to bring about a successful
evocation:
<br><br>1. If he intends to call a spirit being of a certain sphere into his
sphere, no matter whether he calls it into the triangle, the mirror,
or into a fluid condenser, he must bear in mind that the being is
only able to move about in an atmosphere appropriate to its own
sphere. He therefore must artifically create the spheric atmosphere
by accumulating the light, the material of the sphere,
either into the triangle, or preferably into the whole room in
which he is working. If working with a magic mirror it has to be
impregnated or condensed respectively with the according light
material of the sphere. When operating in the open air, the impregnation
must be kept within such limits that the beings or
powers that are to manifest themselves have sufficient room to
move about. The accumulated or impregnated light must have a
colour which is in accordance with the colour-law of the individual
planet. I have already given the reader and student a
detailed information on this question of impregnating or accumulating
light in space in "Initiation into Hermetics" in the
chapter dealing with space-impregnation. If, for instance, a being
of the Moon-sphere is evoked outside oneself, the light, or rather
the material to be accumulated, must be of a silvery white colour;
in the case of a being of Mercury the light-material must be
opalescent; beings from Venus must have a green, beings from the
Sun a golden yellow, from Mars a red, from Jupiter a blue, from
Saturn a violet light, etc.
<br><br>If, for instance, the magician calls a being of the earth-element,
he must get the element of the earth into the magic triangle or the
magic mirror by the help of his imagination. If he wants to call to
him a being from the Moon, he must create the vibration of the
Moon sphere. No being is able to dwell in a sphere not appropriate
to it. If, in case of citation, this principle is not adhered
to, a being might be forced to come to our physical sphere, but it
would, in such a case, have to create, by itself, the necessary
spheric vibration. The magician would, in this case, lose his control
over the being, and his authority, too, would suffer from
such a failure, for the being would consider the magician as not
perfect and would therefore not pay him respect and would
refuse to obey him. Strictly adhering to and acting according to
this principle is most important when evocations are carried out,
and this must never be forgotten by a true magician.
<br><br>2. The magician must be able to place himself, with his consciousness,
during the evocation, into the sphere of the being
cited, so that the being will behold him. This transplanting of
one's spirit is done under the laws of the Akasha-principle, i. e. by
the magician's putting himself into a state of trance in which he
does not know any time or space, and it is in this state that he
cites, according to his will, and due to his authority etc. the being
concerned. Without these faculties the magician is not able to
make a being appear.
<br><br>3. The magician must call forth, by means of his magical
authority, the being's awe and obedience, for otherwise no being
- no matter whether positive or negative - would respect him.
The magical authority or influence of the magician does not
work on a being due to the magician's personality, but because he
has influenced or bound himself with an intelligence superior to
the being or appears as a deity in the aspect authoritative to the
being. It is thus not the magician who makes his influence work
on the being, but the authority of the superior being or of the
highest possible intelligence; of the evoking deity itself. When
practising evocation, the magician will first influence or ally
himself with the superior intelligence. He will only take on the
shape of the highest quality for his self-assertion as an authority
and show it in obstinate cases in which the being should try to
oppose anyhow. If the magician were to try to influence the being
evoked by his own personality only, the being could refuse to obey
him, or could, for the worse, deceive him in a most shocking
manner. If, however, the being is actually receiving his orders
from a superior intelligence, or even God in any aspect, not from
the magician himself, then the being must, under any circumstance,
obey the order. The magician has already learned
from "Initiation into Hermetics", the identification with an intelligence
or with a divine aspect where I wrote about the community
with the individual god.
<br><br>One can see from what has been said above that these three
principles have never been mentioned in any instructions,
because no author has ever had personal experience in the magic
of evocation. They have therefore derived their teaching methods
from other written sources which, in fact, were also incomplete.
Without adhering strictly to the three basic principles no successful
evocation is possible!
<br><br>Before a magician starts with the evocation of beings he must
have the whole procedure precisely entered into the book of formulae
and should, if possible, know it by heart, so that he is not
delayed during his operations by any looking up. It is possible
that difficulties will arise at the beginning of the magician's practice,
but soon the repeated evocation of beings will increase his
self-confidence. Besides that, he will realize that an evocation is
not just the calling of a being, but a regular ritual, composed of a
whole number of magical operations. The magician must make
sure that no hiatus exists in this rite, for each hiatus would be a
disturbance not only to the magician, but also to the being evoked.
A faultless operation is that which the grimoires call the complete
circle. This expression does not refer to the circle that is
drawn by the magician for his protection, and as a symbol of the
microcosm and macrocosm, which is of the relationship to God,
but it refers to the total coherent magical operation. The purpose
of the evocation, too, must be laid down in writing before its
beginning, for during the evocation no additional questions may
be raised.
<br><br>As one can guess from the whole procedure of preparation, a
cautiously prepared and precisely completed magical evocation
requires much time. If, by repeated intercourse with one and the
same being, the magician has established a good connection, so
that the being pays him absolute obedience and thereby completely
acknowledges his magical authority, the magician may,
to save time, arrange a different way to contact the being either
by an abbreviated individual rite, or even just a word for the
evocation of the being and by getting the being's approval for
this, or he may cause the being to choose an abridged method to
which the being itself and its servants are bound to react at any
time. This abridged method, too, has to be written into the book
of furmulae conscientiously, so that during its practical application
no mistakes occur. This is especially important should the
magician have entered into a number of connections with beings.
If the simplified method is offered by a being who, at the same
time requests the magician not to write down the procedure, but
just to remember it well, the magician must respect such a request.
Even if the magician is allowed to make some provisional
notes on this abridged procedure, these notes, like the whole
book of formulae, must never get into the hands of other people,
not even into the hands of a genuine magician, the only exception
being those cases where the being, the originator of the simplified
procedure, agrees to the magician's handing the procedure over to
somebody else, or even asks for this. Otherwise the magician
should never dare to evade a prohibition or even break it, unless
he does not mind his authority being shaken. What this would
mean for a magician need not be further discussed here.
<br><br>A being first appears to a magician in the same manner as it is
accustomed to move about in its own native zone. If the magician
is not pleased with the way in which the being appears, he may,
by means of his magical authority, cause the being to appear in
the shape he approves of. There are no restrictions in this respect,
and it is up to the magician to decide which shape the being evoked
should, by help of his imagination, take on. The sex, too, is in
this case of no consequence. The magician will, however, do well
not to insist, for instance, in a being's appearing in a male shape, if
in its relevant sphere it has been a female creature, although the
being would have to do even this, should the magician insist upon
it. Therefore, beginners in magic operations are recommended to
let a being appear in the shape familiar to its own zone.
<br><br>The magician converses with a being in his own familiar
language. Since he is, in any case, in an elevated state, in the state
of trance, his language automatically changes into the spiritual
language, into the so-called metaphorical language and is so
understood by the being. The being, too, who normally uses its
own language, will converse in this spiritual language, which
again will be translated automatically into the language with
which the magician is familiar. Due to this fact the magician will
at first have the feeling that the answers by the being come from
his own subconscious much in the same manner as a person's inner
voice is heard. By and by the magician will get used to this
and will finally realise that the being is actually speaking outside
him, and after repeated work in this field it will appear to him to
be the same as if he were talking to one of his fellow-men.
<br><br>The unwanted accompanying factors mentioned in the
grimoires, for instance the vandalism of beings, creakings,
thunderstorms, flashes of lightning and other disturbances which
are said to usually accompany evocations are totally unknown to
the genuine magician and may only occur with necromancers and
sorcerers who have undergone no magical training, or with people
who have left the necessary preparatory operations unobserved
or who have made only little preparation for a true evocation.
A genuine magician will not experience any unwanted accompanying
phenomena, and his evocations will run as smoothly as if
he were carrying out any other physical, astral or spiritual actions.
<br><br>In the beginning a magician will do well not to ask a being
too many questions, but to address it with only a few concrete
questions. They should refer to the sphere from which the being
has come. No questions should be asked that would infringe
upon the dignity of the being. At a later date a being, an intelligence,
a head or the servants set at the magician's disposal,
may be asked to play an active part; they need not be used for the
conveyance of knowledge only. The beings, in general, like to
serve a genuine magician and help him in an unselfish manner as
much as lies in their power. A magician certainly will never be so
silly as to ask a spirit being to bring him treasures or to do for
him heavy physical work, since the effect of the being's display of
power in our physical world depends on the fuel (i. e. the material
used for its materialisation) that the magician puts at its disposal.
<br><br>At first the beings will only be able to do mental work. Later,
when the magician has enough experience, they will do astral and
after some time also physical work for him, though the magician
is recommended not to burden a spirit being with physical jobs,
for it would have to carry out such duties in exactly the same
manner as the magician with his acquired magic faculties. The beings
make use of the same powers that are used by the magician
for his personal operations. This means that to do physical work
they need the fluids of elements, i. e. the electrical or magnetic
fluid, and take into account the Akasha-principle, just as the magician
himself. The beings usually draw the matter or substance and
the power out of the atmosphere of the magician. Therefore a
magician should always bear in mind that every evocation is done
at his own cost. This is reason enough for the magician not to
carry out an evocation for the mere satisfaction of other people's
curiosity, and he will, as already mentioned, practise an evocation
first of all to help his fellow-men, or to increase his power over
beings and elements and so acquire more personal experience.
<br><br>For the actual evocation of beings no spells or similar nonsense
is necessary. Since, during the whole time of the evocation, the
magician is in an elevated state, in a true relationship with God,
he places himself with his consciousness into the sphere of the
chosen being and, after having called out its name, asks the being
to appear to him. The being hears the magician, at once reacts to his
call, and quite willingly comes near him. A true magician will
never be obliged to threaten a being or do anything of that sort in
order to make the being obedient to his will. This may only happen
with stubborn demons to whom the magician demonstrates
the power of his relationship to God. In the case of a true relationship
to God, hardly any being, no matter what rank it may
have, will ever dare to place itself in opposition to the divinity,
for the divinity is the power by which the being was created, and
therefore it must be respected.
<br><br>Since, for the magician, the saying is true that the stars influence,
but do not force, it is left to the magician to fix the time
for the evocation according to astrological rules, provided that he
has a fundamental knowledge of astrology and is therefore able to
fix the favourable planetary moments in respect of the relevant
beings.
<br><br>All the various ways of evocation described in grimoires are not
for magicians but for sorcerers. Therefore, for a true magician,
the instructions given in a grimoire are useless, and consequently
the magician will put them aside. He knows the true path of initiation,
he knows, too, how an evocation is to be carried out, and
he is therefore convinced that he will fully succeed in his operations.
<br><br>After the end of the evocation it is the magician's duty to send
the spirit being back to its sphere, i. e. to discharge it. He accompanies
it with his consciousness and, in doing so, he has an inner
feeling of satisfaction and certainty that the being will return to
the sphere from which it has been called and from which it has
come. All the implements used for the evocation are returned by
the magician to their depository and all accumulated powers are
again discharged by his will and imagination. And this is the end
of the evocation.
<br><br><strong>The Practice of Magical Evocation<A name=practice></A></strong>
<br><br>The magician will certainly find it useful if an example of a genuine
evocation is given here, for in no book written up to now
will he find such an exact description of an evocation in accordance
with the universal laws. As far as the general set-up is concerned,
it is left to the magician to make any small changes or additions
here and there and to adapt it to individual situations and
circumstances under which he intends to carry out the evocation.
The best thing, of course, is, if he has available for this high purpose
a special room which will only be entered by him alone. In
such a case he should not even ask another person to do the
necessary cleaning. A room like that will, in the truest sense of
the word, serve as a temple. If the magician is in such a lucky
situation, he is able to have regard to all laws of analogy, and he
can furnish and adapt the room in the same way as the old magicians
had their temples established, which had an altar in the east.
The magician may, in accordance with the degree of his maturity
and his religious belief, place on the altar a symbol of his deity, or
he may set up in the middle of the altar a magic mirror, like the
old initiates and magi did, and place on either side of it a
candlestick with seven arms and a censer between them. Formerly
temples were usually embellished by four colomns ornamented
with various symbolic figures, each column representing one of
the elements. The walls were decorated with pictures symbolising
various deities of the four elements. In the days of yore only such
initiates as were members of the highest social circles could afford
such temples. Unfortunately there will be only few people also
today so wealthy that they can afford such a splendidly equipped
magical workshop.
<br><br>This information refers only to the essentials, and every magician,
whether poor or wealthy, should therefore be able to practise
magical evocation, even should he have no special room at his
disposal. The magician is not bound to any special place, and he
may carry out the citation in a bed-room as well as in a kitchen;
even an attic or a suitable place in a cellar may serve the purpose
and enable the magician to carry out a faultless evocation. If the
magician has none of the above mentioned possibilities, then all
he needs to do is to betake himself to a lonely place somewhere in
the open air where he is sure that he is not being watched by
anybody and, consequently, can work without being disturbed.
<br><br>Of course, conditions like this cannot be taken into consideration
in detail in the description, and every magician should know best
how and where he may carry out his operations. Since it is easy to
understand, I have chosen as the example of an evocation the
Venus-intelligence called HAGIEL. The magician will, of course,
proceed in the same manner in respect of any other spirit being or
intelligence; however, he will always have to take into consideration
the laws of analogy effective in each individual sphere in
respect of the accumulation of coloured light.
<br><br>Before the magician begins the actual evocation he must know
in advance exactly, apart from having worked out a precise plan,
from which plane or sphere he intends to call a being, or intelligence,
and what he indends to ask from it. In part two of this
book, dealing with the hierarchy of beings, the magician will find
a number of good, (i. e. positive) beings of various individual
spheres, a large selection, enabling him to choose the being, according
to his wish, which will help him to realize his plans. It must
be understood, however, that this book by no means gives the
reader complete information on all beings and intelligences, for
there are thousands of them in each plane and sphere. But the intelligences
mentioned will be, in general, sufficient for practical
work.
<br><br>Let us assume that the magician has decided to evoke the
Venus-intelligence named Hagiel and that he intends to ask this
intelligence for luck and success in his operations in which he has
to rely on the friendship and sympathy of a certain person; for
the Venus-intelligence will serve this purpose well, since it is endowed
with all such faculties as friendship, love, luck and success.
<br><br>Before starting the evocation the magician takes a bath or at least
cleans his whole body, for one should not evoke a being in an
unclean state, especially if a high and good intelligence is to be
evoked. An evocation not only requires a clean spirit and a clean
soul, it also requires a clean body. If it is not possible to bathe or
to wash the whole body, the magician must at least carefully wash
his hands. Everybody is able to do this, and therefore it must
never be forgotten. When washing the magician has to concentrate
on the idea that all unfavourable physical and psychic influences
run off with the water. Prepared in this manner, the
magician takes his magical implements, one after the other, from
their depository and puts them on a clean, preferably new, piece
of cloth which has been kept in the depository especially for this
purpose and which is to protect the implements from dust. Let us
assume that the evocation of Hagiel is carried out in a normal
living-room. See that during the whole evocation you are not
disturbed by anything, and, in order to evade any glances of
curiosity, cover the windows carefully with a curtain. Then go
and change your clothes, i. e. put on your magic garments: first
your silk stockings - in cold weather your silk underwear - and
houseshoes. The evocation already starts with the act of dressing;
for you must concentrate on the thoughts which are to do with
the evocation only. So bear in mind that by putting on the
clothes you are insulated against all unfavourable influences that
may come from the universe or the invisible world. When dressing,
you must be entirely sure that your body is not being influenced
by any being, whether good or evil. Then, after having
dressed, this meditative attitude of being completely insulated and
protected must be maintained. Then put round your waist your
magic belt and be completely taken up by the thought that you
are the sovereign over all elements, the master of all powers.
<br><br>Finally you put round your head your magus-band or put on the
magic headgear with a feeling of true relationship to God, and
that not you as a magician, but that God is actually carrying
through the whole operation. You must unite yourself with the
divine principle inside you in such a way that you have the feeling
that you are the deity itself. Having done all this, you are able to
go a further step in your operation. You light the magic lamp,
which, in our case, must fill the room with a lightgreen light. Set
the magic lamp in a place round which you will be able to draw
the magic circle or hang it up in the centre of the room. This does
not mean that the lamp must be exactly in the centre of the room
though it would have the advantage that the whole room gets an
equal light. Your next task will be the setting up and impregnation
of the magic mirror, if you like, of two magic mirrors. In this example
instructions are given for the use of two mirrors. One mirror
is to bring about the materialization of Hagiel in the physical
world, the other is to keep off unwanted influences. Being conscious
of the fact that not you, but the deity is carrying out the
procedure, you create, by the help of the imagination, a great sea
of light in a wonderful emerald colour, which, also by imagination,
you accumulate from the whole universe into the mirror in a
manner that the whole surface of the mirror is taken up by this
colour. The power of illumination of the condensed green light
must be so strong as to illuminate completely the room in which
you work. At that moment you must have the imaginative impression
that this accumulated light is actually a power matrix, a
fluid, which can almost be seen by the physical eye. In any case
you must have the permanent impression that you are moving
about in the room in an oscillation of green light. This is the way
to prepare, magically, the room for the being to be evoked, and in
a room like this there will be no more obstacles for the being and
it will feel the atmosphere of its own sphere. Already at the moment
you accumulate the light you concentrate on the idea that
the purpose of this accumulation is to condense the evoked spirit
being in a manner that you can see it with your physical eyes and
hear it with your physical ears. The stronger your imagination,
belief, will and conviction, the better condensed and truer Hagiel
will appear to you. When impregnating the room, do not forget
to include that you wish the accumulated planetary light-power
to remain in the mirror and in the room until you dissolve it
again by force of your imagination.
<br><br>Similar examples are given in "Initiation into Hermetics" in the
chapter dealing with room-impregnation and here you find the
evidence that all the exercises and magic operations of that first
work have their special purpose. You will also see that when carrying
out further magical operations you will not be able to do
without any of these practices. If you have not actively gone
through the exercises of the first book you are unable to get into
conscious contact with any spirit being outside you, or of
materialising such a being.
<br><br>Now you start impregnating the other mirror by charging it
with the Akasha-principle. Project, by force of imagination, into
the surface of the mirror, which previously has been covered with
a fluid condenser, the desire that not any disturbing being, not
any unwanted power or the like will penetrate into your
workroom, into your evocational operating-room. This has been
the second step of your evocation. The room in which you work
is now appropriately impregnated. However, you have yet
another possibility: you can impregnate the mirror that you intend
to use for keeping off unwanted influences with the wish
that the being you want to evoke must appear in it. This impregnation,
of course, must have accumulated light in the relevant
planetary colour. In our case it must be green.
<br><br>Now take a piece of blotting paper and cut into the shape of a
heptagon.* In its middle draw with green ink, or what is even better,
with a green coloured pencil, the seal of Hagiel. (See picture
below**). Symbolically redraw the seal with your magic wand or
with the finger, concentrating into the seal Hagiel's qualities,
which are luck, love, friendship etc. Before the operation you can
let the blotting paper soak in a fluid condenser and get dry again.
<br><br><small>* With regard to the various spheres the
blotting paper must have the following
shapes:
<br><br>for the sphere of Saturn a triangle
<br>of Jupiter a quadrangle
<br>of Mars a pentagon
<br>of the Sun a hexagon
<br>of Venus a heptagon
<br>of Mercury an octagon
<br>of the Moon a nonagon
<br><br>As far as the earth-zone or any other
zones are concerned the round shape of
the seal is to be maintained.</small>
<br>
<br>Moreover you must concentrate on the idea that this intelligence
is allied to the sign and will react to it at any time and be always
willing to perform that which you, the magician, want it to perform.
<br><br>You must be aware of the fact that it is not you who draws
the afore-mentioned sign, but God, and that therefore the intelligence
will render absolute obedience to God. With this
meditative attitude in mind, a failure is quite impossible. Your
seal is now ready and you can start preparing the circle and the
triangle. If you have a circle sewn into a piece of cloth or painted
on a piece of paper you put it on the floor beside the triangle and
once more run over its lines with the magic wand or with your
right hand, or with one finger of your right hand, meditating on
the idea that they represent the eternity, the microcosm and
macrocosm, that they are symbolizing the whole universe in its
great and in its small aspect. The circle, in the middle of which
you must stand when calling the intelligence, is for you the small
and the great world. Your meditative attitude must be so strong
that no other idea can exist in your mind at that moment.
<br><br>You follow the same procedure when re-drawing the triangle,
which represents the three dimensional world, i. e. the mental,
astral and physical world. In order that the intelligence you intend
to evoke should appear not only in its mental, but also in its
astral and physical shape, you must include this wish when you
concentrate on your meditative attitude towards the triangle.
Your imagination at the moment of drawing (i. e. re-drawing) the
magic triangle is as important and essential as the drawing (i. e. redrawing)
of the magic circle. The magician determines the shape
and the range of effectivity of the intelligence that is to appear. If
he omits this, Hagiel will only appear to him in her mental shape
and will consequently, only be present in the magician's mind.
The manifestation of Hagiel would not succeed: not as far as her
appearance and, naturally, also not as far as her influencing power
is concerned. If these preparations are finished, too, you put the
triangle in front of the circle and place the seal prepared in the
middle of the triangle. Some magicians intensify the threedimensional
effect of the being to be evoked by placing into each
corner of the triangle a small spirit lamp and by lighting it. The
fuel he uses must be an extract of spirit and camomile, i. e. a fluid
condenser in which the magician has already accumulated, by the
help of imagination, the three-dimensional world. When the
spirit lamps, which are provided with small wicks, are burning,
much like the spirit lamps of laboratories, the power of imagination
concentrated in the fuel slowly expands in the room as the
fuel slowly evaporates. By this, the materialization of the evoked
being is supported. However, the setting up of spirit lamps is not
absolutely necessary, but it is a good aid, especially for beginners,
for a beginner in evocational practice needs many more supports
than a magician with experience in this kind of work. Beginners
may place such lamps, in regular intervals, not only in the
triangle but also along the line inside the circle. The number of
lamps to be placed inside the circle depends on the analogous
number of the relevant planet. In our case an intelligence is involved
which belongs to the sphere of Venus to which the
number seven appertains. For your information the relevant
numbers are given below which belong to the planets: if
necessary, use
<br><br>for the Earth-zone 10 lamps
<br>for zone of the Moon 9 lamps
<br>of Mercury 8 lamps
<br>of Venus 7 lamps
<br>of the Sun 6 lamps
<br>of Mars 5 lamps
<br>of Jupiter 4 lamps
<br>of Saturn 3 lamps
<br><br>The magician may also symbolise the elements in the circle, in
which case he only needs 4 lamps. He himself stands in the middle
of the circle as the fifth element, as the representative of the
Akasha-principle. When setting up the lamps, the magician takes
into consideration the four cardinal points and places a lamp in
the East, West, South and North side of the circle. It is entirely
left to the magician either to express by the lamps the planetary
number or to symbolise the elements.
<br><br>Of course, it is also possible for him to draw three circles. In the
middle circle he puts four lamps, as the symbol of the elements,
into the external circles he places the number of lamps analogous
to the symbolic number of the planet from which the being is to
be called. Naturally, the setting up of lamps will complicate the
preparations for the evocation but the person able to provide
himself with such lamps should not desist from using this aid, for
the more aids to support his consciousness he has at the beginning,
the better will he succeed.
<br><br>The censer now comes into the picture. The magician either
places it between the circle and the triangle or directly into the
triangle. The censer is either filled with burning charcoal, or has a
wick and over this a little copper plate fixed. This plate is heated
by the flame. The powder in the censer must in all cases correspond
to the being's sphere and is to be placed on the plate. Since,
in our case, we are dealing with an intelligence from Venus,
ground Cinnamon-bark will suffice as incense. Only a small
quantity should be used so that the room just faintly smells of cinnamon.
cinnamon-tincture can also be used, and a few drops of
this substance must then be poured on the copper-plate. You will
get this liquid substance from any chemist, though, you may also
prepare it yourself, if you wish. Just mix normal cinnamon with
two thirds of spirit of wine and let it stand and draw for eight
days. After this period filter it and the cinnamon tincture is ready
for use. If, during magical operations, you do not intend to work
with a censer, put a few drops of cinnamon tincture on a piece of
blotting paper. In either case the smell of cinnamon will create a
temple-atmosphere agreeable to the intelligence of Hagiel, and
this atmosphere will also help with the materialization of the intelligence
in our physical world. The censering of the room,
however, is not at all so important as some books would have it.
It is just another aid.
<br><br>Surplus censering of the room usually has the disadvantage of
making the magician to cough, which is neither desirable nor
agreeable. Pernicious poisoning drugs and mixtures of narcotic
substances will never be used by a true magician. If the magician
is dealing with a being not belonging to any of the seven
planetary spheres and is not sure about the exact analogy in
respect of the incense he may use a universal fluid condenser
when he censes his room. This rule is mainly applicable for beings
coming from the earth-zone. The fluid condenser has to be
appropriately impregnated, i. e. the accumulation of the light fuel
has to be carried out at the same time as the magician is concentrating
on the wish for success.
<br><br>Below you will find a list of the incenses to be applied for the
various spheres. It must, however, be pointed out that incense can
only serve as an aid for the materialization at the beginning. It is
by no means absolutely necessary.
<br><br>1. Zone Girdling the Earth:
Sage powder and elder-pith, in equal parts;
<br><br>2. Moon-sphere:
aloe-powder as the. only drug to be used, or intensified in the
form of a mixture in equal parts of aloe, white poppy, storax, ben-
Zoe and pulveris camphoris (of the latter, however, only a very
small pinch!);
<br><br>3. Mecury-sphere:
use mastic as the only incense, or, as an intensifying mixture,
equal parts of mastic, incense, carnation blossoms, aniseed,
juniper wood, camomile blossoms and valerian roots; everything
in pulverized state;
<br><br>4. Venus-sphere:
take pulverized cinnamon as the only incense, or pulverized cinnamon
flowers (flores kassia);
in intensified form: cinnamon, rose blossoms, coriander seed
quiendel blossoms (not lavender, but flores Serpilli), lily
blossoms; all in equal quantities and pulverized state;
<br><br>5. Sun-sphere:
as an isolated incense use sandalwood-powder; as an itensified
substance use a mixture of the following drugs: sandalwoodpowder,
myrrh, aloewood-powder, incense, saffron, carnation
blossoms, laurel leaves (all in equal quantities);
<br><br>6. Mars-sphere:
as an isolated incense pulverized seeds of onions may be useQ; as
an intensified substance use the following mixture seeds of
onions, leaves of stinging nettles, grains of mustard seed, hemp
seeds, rue-leaves and peppermint-leaves; all in equal quantities and
in pulverized form;
<br><br>7. Jupiter-sphere:
use as an isolated incense pulverized saffron and as an intensified
incense take a mixture of saffron, linseed, roots of the violet,
peony blossoms, betony leaves and birch leaves; an equal quantity
of each in pulverized state;
<br><br>8. Saturn-sphere:
as an isolated incense use pulverised black poppy seed; as an intensified
incense take a mixture of the following in pulverized state
and in equal quantities: black poppy seeds, willow leaves, rue
leaves, fern, cumin, fennel seeds.
<br><br>For all other spheres a substance in form of a universal mixture
will suffice: church incense, myrrh, storax, benzoe and aloe
(pulverized and in equal quantities).
<br><br>For each act of censering only the point of a knife should be used
either with the uniform drug or the mixture for each evocation.
It is not necessary to fill the room with dense smoke; it quite
suffices just to have the smell of the relevant drugs.
<br><br>Having done this, another preparatory step of the evocation has
been completed, and you can now start with the actual evocation.
Since we are dealing, in the assumed case, with Hagiel, that is,
with a positive planetary intelligence, you may fasten your magic
sword to your magic belt, on the left side of your body. If you
have among your magical implements a dagger, you also put this
implement under your belt, for a good being - no matter from
which sphere it may come - will hardly ever require the use of a
sword or a dagger. If, however, you were dealing with a demonic
being, you would have to hold the dagger or sword in your right
hand as the symbol of victory; your magic wand would, in such a
case, have to be in your left. By putting the sword to your belt
you express the idea that the being concerned will not have to be
forced by any means to do your will. With regard to stubborn beings
the magician will not be able to do without the sword or dagger.
<br><br>Negative beings are ordered by the magician, with the help
of the flaming sword as the symbol of victory, to render him absolute
obedience and to do whatever he wants. There exists not
one demonic being which the magician would not be able to
make obedient to his will. All he needs to do is to hold the point
of his sword in the direction of the place where he wants the being
to appear and the negative being will immediately do what
the magician orders it to do. Since every being has a drive of selfpreservation,
all demons are afraid of the magic sword or dagger,
for in true relationship with God a magic sword or dagger would,
to speak symbolically, tear a demon to pieces.
<br><br>Take your magic wand into your right hand, step into the centre
of the circle and concentrate on the idea that you are the centre,
that you are God, the sovereign of all spheres and that you are
with your all-consciousness at the same moment in the Venus-sphere.
<br><br>As a divine principle you call in your mind the intelligence
Hagiel as if you would call its name, in your mind,
throughout the whole sphere of the Venus. You must be convinced
that your calling the name is heard everywhere in the Venussphere
and that Hagiel, acknowledging you as her God, also hears
you. Remain in this state of stress for a few moments, for your
spirit will then conceive that Hagiel is answering you in your
mind. Since you are in the Venus-sphere with your allconsciousness
you will first register Hagiel's voice as if it were
coming from the inmost depth of your own spirit. As soon as you
hear the voice of Hagiel and as soon as you are sure that you see
the spirit being, you return to your soul, keeping up your consciousness
of being God himself, and you will find yourself reunited
with your soul within your physical body. Now call for
Hagiel again, this time actually whispering, and repeat the name a
few times in the same manner. You will at once realize that
Hagiel is already in your astral atmosphere, that she is already
present in your room. If your operations have been successfully
carried on up to this moment where Hagiel has come to your
place of working, above the seal, then call in an undertone, or
even aloud, that Hagiel should appear to you physically. At the
moment of transition from the astral to the physical world never
forget to convince yourself of the three forms of existence of your
personality, so that you feel yourself allied to the astral body as a
spirit and that you are with both these bodies at the same time in
your physical body. This act of self-control is to help the being to
follow the course of your thoughts and to betake itself from its
own sphere into the sphere which you have prepared for it in
your room. This means that the being appears in its mental and
astral shape and that, depending on your power to materialize, it
also assumes a physically condensed body.
<br><br>You can now see and hear Hagiel in your magic triangle, or, if
you have appropriately prepared your magic mirror for the appearance
of this intelligence, Hagiel will appear in the mirror in
accordance with her symbolic lay-out of the qualities of the
Venus-sphere so that you are able to contact Hagiel consciously.
Hagiel will appear in the shape of a queen with a most beautiful
face, clear eyes and a well-shaped body. She is dressed in a green
dress embroidered with gold and her head is ornamented with a
royal crown. Her voice is so delightful that it cannot be described
and everybody would regard Hagiel as the incarnation of beauty.
Now it is up to you to tell this intelligence what you desire. If
you intend to contact Hagiel repeatedly then do not forget to
make arrangements at this first meeting in which simple manner
you may in future call this high and beautiful spirit being. If you
are interested you can also win Hagiel's servants for you. These
are usually represented to the magician in their female shape. The
servants of the Venus-queen are also very beautiful, as the magician
may see himself.
<br><br>Evocations like these will bring you the most diverse experiences.
To give you details on them in this connection is quite
impossible. It is, however, left to the magician's own will to gain
as much experience as he wants. I can only give here a few hints
from my own experience as to how he has to go about, as a genuine
magician, the evocation of beings.
<br><br>If you have reached an agreement with Hagiel on everything
and if Hagiel has promised to fulfil your wishes, you can be sure
that she will really keep her promise. All that now remains for
you to do is to send this intelligence off again. You offer your
thanks quite individually, for instance, by expressing your
pleasure in the fact that Hagiel wholly acknowledges you as a genuine
magician and is obedient to you, and then you ask the intelligence
to return to her own sphere. With your allconsciousness
you place yourself into the Venus sphere and concentrate
by means of the imagination that Hagiel is returning
from the partial sphere of your room to her domicil. After having
done this meditative step you return as a magician from your allconsciousness
to your normal consciousness, thereby bringing
the evocation to an end. Staying in the room in which you have
carried out the evocation you will find yourself, for a while after
Hagiel's departure, in a state of happiness, a feeling of bliss will
pervade you, and, as if dominated by true happiness, you will find
yourself in a state of exaltation. If you please, you may remain in
the room within the magic circle for some time and reconstruct
the whole experience with Hagiel once more in your mind so
that you will remember well every part of it when you completely
finish your evocation. By help of imagination you dissolve the
accumulated light into the universe, take the sign out of the
triangle and put it away in safe keeping. You can leave the circle
without any danger, put out the lamps, etc. All magical instruments
and aids are returned to their repository. If Hagiel has
informed you of any special knowledge which you should not
put down in writing, but merely keep well in your head, the
knowledge being intended for you alone, then you must comply
with such a wish. Otherwise you enter the procedure of the
whole evocation into your diary to enable you to keep a good
control over your workings and to have a reference book for
them. You can follow the same procedure as with Hagiel in
respect of any other being from any other sphere. By and by you
will also become a perfect master in this respect and your personal
experience will grow immensely.
<br><br>The description of the practice of a magical evocation is
herewith completed.
<br><strong><font size="5">Part II<A name=hierarchy></A></font><br><br>
 HIERARCHY</strong>
<br>In this part of the book a description will be given only of those
beings which I contacted personally a long time ago either by
evocations or by mental wandering to the various planes and
spheres, for to describe all the beings of the entire hierarchy is
something quite impossible. However, this does not mean that
the magician is strictly bound to the hierarchic order given below
and that he should only get into contact with the beings mentioned
here. If he uses other sources giving information on certain beings
he should be able to gain control over such beings, too, and
have his eventual wishes fulfilled. The magic literature has a lot of
books dealing with different beings, their seals etc., and the magician
is free to use these too.
<br><br>I deliberately desist from writing about demons of any rank and
sphere in order to prevent, from the beginning, any negative application.
Nevertheless, due to his development up to now and
due to the exact instructions here given, the magician will be able
to evoke demons also and to get them under his control. Apart
from that, many a work of magical literature, be it an ancient or
a modern one, will offer him further information on demons of
various spheres, of their faculties, seals, etc. The magician will be
able to place any being, positive or negative, into its correct order
of the relevant zone or sphere according to the hierarchy laid out
here. The beings mentioned here are known only to a few initiates
who have had connections with them, therefore the magician
may, if he likes, use this hierarchy for his work. If he gets into
contact with any being during his mental or astral wandering he
is able to name at once the sphere from which this being comes.
In cases like these the esoteric synthesis of astrology as well as the
quabbalah with its analogies will serve him well. A person knowing
much about quabbalah will give at once the right name to a
being judging from its qualities, colour etc. without being deluded
by the possibility that the being might, at that moment, be
given another name than its usual one. The magician knows that
the name is actually the mirror of the being's true fundamental
qualities.
<br><br>Each seal, which actually represents the being's fundamental
qualities is used in the magic of evocation to call the relevant being,
by the help of its sigil, into the triangle in front of the circle.
After the operation the seal may be destroyed. In this case, if the
seal was drawn on a piece of blotting paper soaked with a fluid
condenser with the corresponding planetary colour, the seal is
destroyed in its elements in a manner which depends on the element
to which it has reference. Thus seals of beings of the fire and
air-principle are to be burnt, seals of beings of the water principle
must be torn to pieces and thrown into flowing water, seals of beings
of the earth principle must be buried.
<br><br>Furthermore, beings may be called by talismans. In such a case
the relevant signs are to be engraved on apt metal plates and
should be placed in the triangle before the circle at the time of the
first evocation or contact. The being evoked must then
acknowledge this seal and get into contact with it, that is with its
relevant sphere, by itself. Such a seal need naturally not be
destroyed, but can be put away with the being's consent. If the
magician wants to contact the being in order to see it in his magic
mirror, or if he wants to have it fulfil a certain wish, he needs only
to take the seal into his hand. All details, of course, depend
upon a mutual agreement with the being. Years ago I used to take
a seal with a certain being's character engraved on it in one hand,
and with it draw the sigil in the air in a magical (i. e. three dimensional)
manner. By doing this the sign was transposed directly into
the Akasha-principle. At once I was in contact with the being,
as I wished it. This, of course, may only serve as an example, for a
magician who wants to contact a certain being may make his individual
arrangements.
<br><br>Should a magician want to keep up a constant connection with
a certain sphere or being he needs only to carry the seal with him
all the time, either as an amulet, a ring, or anything similar.
However, it is not wise to wear an amulet for a long time with
the sign of a being, for the magician would become too dependent
on the being and could lose his equilibrium and magical authority.
A well trained magician is able to manufacture, at any time,
his own seal, after having got the being under his control, and to
engrave on it the character of that being in the form of the relevant
sign, and he can then charge the seal himself, in the magical
way, with the being's qualities, without having to contact the being
for this purpose, i. e. without any preceding evocation. The
charging of the seal has to be carried out in the way indicated in
"Initiation into Hermetics" in the chapter dealing with the charging
of talismans. But it is important to know that the magician
can only practise this if he is master over the being in question. If
he carries out this practice though he has not full control over the
being, he puts himself into immediate connection with the
being's character and sphere regardless of his wishing to do so or
not. The magical charging of seals in talisman shape may
therefore not be carried out, unless the magician has already
become absolute master of the being or intelligence by magical
evocation.
<br><br>Now I am going to introduce the hierarchy of spirit beings, one
after the other, and will name some beings and intelligences of
every sphere. This may serve as a guide. As already mentioned,
each sphere - according to our measurements - is inhabited by
millions of beings, all of which have different ranks due to their
different qualities and each are given certain ranges of influencing
power. I have set under individual chapters the beings and intelligences
with which I have maintained personal contact. Apart
from these, I have also dealt with many others of the most diverse
spheres, but the ones mentioned below may serve the magician
well as guiding principles for magical evocations, for it must eventually
be left to him to compile his own hierarchy of beings he
gets into contact with by transposing his consciousness into one
sphere or the other.
<br><br><strong>1. The Beings of the Four Elements<A name=four></A></strong>
<br><br>Fig. 1: Pyrhum - In the kingdom of the elements Pyrhum is a
powerful spirit of fire in the rank of a king or sovereign. A great
number of fire-spirits are subject to his power and are constantly
at his disposal. He will reveal special methods to the magician
who rules him; methods by which the magician may have striking
successes with the help of the fire-element. Pyrhum may also
put spirits of the elements at the magician's disposal who, being
in possession of the same powers as he himself, are able to bring
about the same effects as he himself would do. From Pyrhum one
can learn about everything that may be achieved magically by the
pure element of fire. Also in cases where influences through the
fire-element are involved, Pyrhum can bring about the desired effect.
Every magician getting into personal contact with this firespirit
will be able to convince himself of his versatility. The sign
of his seal must be drawn in red colour on a piece of blotting
paper at the time of his first evocation. One may also use a small
iron-plate instead of the blotting paper, and engrave the sign of
seal on it. A talisman produced in this manner must, however,
always have the shape of a pentagon. The latter statement goes for
all signs of seals for beings of the fire-principle.
<br><br>Fig. 2: Aphtiph - is also a spirit of the fire having the same rank
as Pyrhum. He therefore is able to bring about the same effects as
Pyrhum. The only difference between the two lies in the fact that
Aphtiph is not so active as Pyrhum and therefore is easier to control.
He has a greater affection for human beings and can give the
magician various magical information on the fire-element; for instance,
how, by help of the fire-element and various effective rites
excellent effects can be obtained and the like. Aphtiph will initiate
the magician, should he wish it, thoroughly into the magic
of the fire-element, using special methods for this purpose. He is
also quite willing to offer the magician the services of the beings
subject to his authority, and confers the same powers that he
himself possesses to them. The sign of his seal must also be drawn
in red colour for the first evocation.
<br><br>Fig. 3: Orudu - is a much dreaded spirit of high rank in the
realm of fire. Employing his subjects he causes outbreaks of
volcanos either directly or indirectly, and he instigates all matters
that are connected with fierce and great fires. The latter may not
only be caused by him, but can also be controlled and stilled by
him. The magician with Orudu under his control and as his
friend can achieve great things with the help of the fire-element.
Orudu, too, like the other two spirits of the fire, may provide the
magician with subordinated fire-spirits, and many a magician has
been able to achieve many magical arts with the help of the fireelement
and assisted by the beings Orudu placed at his disposal.
The sign of Orudu's seal has to be drawn in yellow colour for his
first evocation.
<br><br>Fig. 4: Itumo - sign to be drawn in yellow colour - is also a
male being of the fire, who likes to be, and to move about, near
the surface of our earth and who has a special capability of causing
heavy thunderstorms, preferably cloudburst, by means of his
subjects. Controlled by a magician, he instructs him how to cause
various types of thunderstorms with his servants and how to stop
them. Everything that may happen in a thunderstorm is effected
by Itumo. By his assistance and by the help of his servants I have
often successfully influenced thunderstorms.
<br><br>Fig. 5: Coroman - sign to be drawn in red colour - has the
rank of a potential head with legions of beings fulfilling various
tasks in the fire-element. Coroman controls the fire-element in
the three kingdoms; the kingdoms of men, animals and plants,
and may have effects through them. He can offer reliable subjects
who are able to help the magician by the force of the fire-element
in any respect, regardless whether he operates ritually with the
sobordinated spirits or whether he has his influence work by the
magic of sympathy. Coroman can introduce the magician to a
great number of practices; especially the curing of sick people
who may be treated with the fire-element.
<br><br>Fig. 6: Tapheth - sign to be drawn in red colour - is, like the
above mentioned being, also a friend of men. He is able to assist
the magician in a number of alchemical operations and to protect
him by his element, i. e. the element of fire. He, too, makes the
magician succeed in various magical operations with the fireelement
and teaches him to recognize the various states in
alchemical operations and to know and control the individual
procedures. Tapheth, too, puts at the magician's disposal good
subordinated beings who can help him in many ways to work
successfully with the element of fire.
<br><br>Fig. 7: Oriman - sign to be drawn in blue colour - is a powerful
fire-spirit who, too, can help the magician with many magical
practices for which the use of the fire-element is essential. His
fundamental qualities of pyrotechnics enable him to make the
magician acquainted with the art of pyrotechnics which may later
also be practised, ritually by the magician himself or by Oriman's
subordinate beings now put at his disposal. Oriman and his
subordinates like to control the work done in gorges and like to
be about places where manual or mechanical work is done by the
help of fire. The magician receives the most interesting information
from Oriman and his subordinated beings on everything
that has to do with pyrotechnics.
<br><br>Fig. 8: Amtophul - sign to be drawn in blue colour - is by no
means lower in rank and power than the beings of the fireelement
already mentioned. This fire-spirit shows the magician
how he can be effective in the kingdom of the fire-element. He instructs
him how to assert his magical authority there so that he
has complete control over any being of the fire-element. Amtophul
therefore is an excellent initiator into the so-called magic
of the fire. The magician is taught by him how to defend himself
against the element of the fire in order to become unassailable by
fire, that is, invulnerable up to a certain degree. The magician is
then afterwards able to take burning coals into his hands without
suffering any harm. But also many other magic arts which can be
realized by the fire-element are freely revealed to the magician by
Amtophul. Nevertheless, Amtophul is, even if completely controlled,
rather a dangerous fire-spirit.
<br><br>Many such fire-spirits of the same rank with whom I formerly
had communication could be mentioned here. However, the
above eight examples will be sufficient for the magician.
<br><br>Next are eight beings of the water-element.
<br><br>Fig. 9: Amasol - red colour to be used for the first evocation -
is commissioned to cause storms on the sea either by himself or
by his subjects or to calm them depending on what Divine Providence
has ordered him to do. Amasol informs the magician
how to get under his control - from the magical as well as the
quabbalistic point of view - the magnetic power of the water. He
places at the magician's disposal also excellent subordinated beings
who help to realize his wishes by the watery element.
<br><br>Fig. 10: Ardiphne - colour of sign also red - is a good initiator
and teaches the magician how he should, by force of the waterelement,
work his influence by ritual magic on man and animal in
the right manner. If the influenced object gets somehow into contact
with the water-element, for instance by rain, washing, drinking
of beverages etc. then Ardiphne or his servants will help to
speed up the influence and, in consequence, to realize the magician's
desires.
<br><br>Fig. 11: Isaphil - colour of sign: silvery white - is a very
beautiful ruler in the kingdom of the water-element. To describe
her beauty by words would give much difficulty even to a
talented poet. Isaphil has many servants known as water fairies or
nymphs. Isaphil knows many magic secrets in relation with
operations with the element of water and can give the magician
much information and reveal to him many practices. However, a
magician has to be very careful with Isaphil, just the same as he
has to take heed in respect to the following sovereign mistress
called Amue, that he does not lose his head when working with
them. Both are experts in binding men by their beauty and taking
possession of them. If the genuine magician wants it, Isaphil will
be pleased to place the beings subordinated to her at his disposal.
<br><br>Fig. 12: Amue - colour of sign also silvery white -. This
female ruler also possesses a great number of watery beings subordinated
to her. If the magician intends to keep up a connection
with Amue he will be instructed by her how to get fish and other
water animals under his power. So, if the magician busies himself,
in this material world, with fishing or rearing fish or the like he
will get from Amue useful advice and instructions which will
enable him to control completely everything that swims or creeps
in the water. Also Amue will place at ~he magician's disposal
subordinate beings who will contribute to the realization of his
wishes.
<br><br>Fig. 13: Aposto - colour of sign: red - is again a male being in
the kingdom of the water-element and rules over all brooks and
rivers, small and large. He informs the magician about what is at
the bottom of brooks and rivers and at which place under water
he can find jewels and semi-jewels. Aposto is completely acquainted
with the magic of the water-principle. If the magician
asks for subordinates, Aposto will be pleased to let him have
them. Such subordinates have often saved people, swimming or
doing other water-sports, from drowning. Besides this, the magician
may learn from these beings where to find the bodies of
drowned people.
<br><br>Fig. 14: Ermot - colour of sign also red - has almost the same
qualities as Aposto, fig. 13. Ermot introduces the magician into
the magic of the water-element and furthermore teaches him how
to manufacture from this element magic volts for certain purposes.
Ermot will gladly place his servants at the magician's
disposal. His fundamental qualities are to make human beings
love each other by help of the water-elements. With women Ermot
is, in this respect, especially influentual.
<br><br>Fig. 15: Osipeh - colour of sign: blue - is a most beautiful
female water-being and not only a complete ruler over this element,
but also of the magic of the water. She likes very much to
introduce the magician into the rhythm of the water-element by
the magic of sounds. She is an excellent singer and dancer as are
also her subordinate beings experts in these arts, and they perform
the nicest dances and accompany them with lovely songs. If
the magician resists the tempting invitations of this female ruler
and gets her under his power, she will place at his disposal several
beings subordinate to her. I know from my own experience that
she likes to serve quite by herself the magician who rules her.
<br><br>Fig. 16: Istiphul - sign of colour also blue - is mentioned here
as the last example of a water-being. She, too, has a female shape.
Apart from being able to make the magician better acquainted
with the magic of water, she can, if he so wishes, make him see
pictures of the past, present or future on the surface of waters or
other liquids. She is mistress in the task of bringing about various
transformations which can be caused by the element of the water.
Amongst other things, she teaches the magician, should he wish
it, how he can cause love in friends or enemies, either by magical
practice alone or by the assistance of her beings. Many a magician
has already been ruined by Istiphul when she succeeded in binding
him by her great art in erotic love and by her beauty. By get"
ting into touch with Istiphul magicians usually lost their interests
in any further, more essential connections; therefore every magician
should always remember that he should rule and never succumb
to any being, no matter of whatever rank or from whatever
sphere.
<br><br>The above described beings are, of course, not the only ones in
the water element, and the magician may, if he likes, get into
touch with further beings of equal rank. Here are now a few beings
of the fourth element, the element of the earth:
<br><br>Fig. 17: Mentifil- colour of sign for the first evocation must be
black - is a mighty king of gnomes in the kingdom under the
earth. He is equipped with many powers and qualities. This
ruler can inform the magician about all medicinal herbs and make
him acquainted with the preparation and effect of herbs and
medicines against all types of diseases from which man or animal
may suffer. Apart from this, Mentifil is a master in alchemical
work and reveals to the magician how the prima materia can be
transformed into the philosopher's stone, i. e. how the lapis
philosophorum is won. He has a great number of gnomes as subjects
who help him with his work and doings in the kingdom of
the earth. The magician who has control over this spirit of the
earth has also a good friend and may learn much from this powerful
ruler of the element of the Earth and enrich his knowledge
with many a secret.
<br><br>Fig. 18: Ordaphe - colour of his sign: black - is also a mighty
king of gnomes. He influences greatly all metals that are to be
found under the surface of the earth. If the magician so wishes,
Ordaphe will lead him through his kingdom and show him all
treasures that are under the earth in the form of ore. He, too, has
a great number of gnomes subordinated to him who do the work
designated to them under the surface of the earth. Some of them
guard the ores, others work on their refinement and maintenance.
Ordaphe likes to place gnomes at the disposal of the magician,
which will at any time assist him in his operations with the earthly
element. However, the magician must be careful not to request
anything coarsely materialistic from him and he must never use
these spirit-servants for avaricious purposes. He would, in that
case, always be in danger of having immense difficulties in getting
out of the range and power of this king of gnomes.
<br><br>Fig. 19: Orova - colour of sign also black - is the next mighty
ruler in the kingdom of gnomes. Apart from the usual range of
powers apertaining to a spirit of the earth Orova has been specially
ordered to guard all stones and precious stones to be found in
the earth. He is able to change pebbles into precious stones and he
can teach the magician how to load stones with the element of the
earth or by any other methods for special purposes. The occult
meaning of all precious stones is well known to Orova, and the
magician can find out about this especially for producing
talismans, lucky stones etc. Should the magician request it, this
powerful ruler over gnomes can place at his disposal many subjucts
of his kingdom. But the magician must take heed not to succumb
to the brilliant appearance of Orova. He should not mind
being taught certain things by beings like this, but he should
never ask for anything material of them, for they like to see magicians
take presents in order to make them dependent.
<br><br>Fig. 20: ldurah - colour of sign also black - is another powerful
ruler over gnomes who is commissioned with crystallisation
in the earth principle. His biggest range of power lies under the
earth where there are crystal products like salts, for instance.
From Idurah the magician will find out where to look for stone
salt or other compounds and will be taught by this king of
gnomes how salts in general develop, is informed about their
chemical and hermetic analogies, and will learn, at the same time,
the occult use of various kinds of salt for magical purposes by the
element of the earth. Idurah knows many secret methods such as
how various salts are derived from plants and minerals and is
quite willing to inform the magician about this. He also introduces
him to their practical use for medical, alchemical purposes
etc. A magician may learn a great deal of things from Idurah
that mere book learning could never give him.
<br><br>Fig. 21: Musar - colour of sign: brown - is also one of the
powerful kings of gnomes and a specialist in the magic of the
earth. He informs the magician about the electro-magnetic drifts
inside the earth, how to control them practically and how to
make use of them. Furthermore Musar will introduce the magician
to the magic of nature, which he is able to practise by the
plus and the minus of the earth, i. e. by the electric and magnetic
fluids. He also learns from this king of gnomes how these two
radiations, which by chemical disintegration influence the life on
and under the earth, originate from the hermetic point of view. In
the kingdom of the element of the earth Musar is one of the most
respected beings. He may be called a genuine magician of the
earth.
<br><br>Fig. 22: Necas - colour of the sign: brown -, also one of
the rulers of gnomes, will explain to the magician the hermetic
procedure of vegetation and its occult meaning. From Necas the
magician can find out how trees, vegetables and all other plants
are being nourished by the drifts and powers under the earth.
He will be informed by him how to accelerate and control the life
of vegetation by the magic of the elements.
<br><br>Fig. 23: Erami - colour of sign: black - is regarded as a powerful
gnome-magician. If requested, he will teach the magician who
controls him all about the magic of sympathy and make him acquainted
with the preparation of the earth-mirror and the various
fluid condensers. Besides this, he will initiate him into the practical
application of the earth-element. The magician will also
learn from Erami how to protect himself against various dangers
by the help of the earth-element. Erami may reveal a great
number of secrets regarding the magic of the kingdom of the
elements, and he will be pleased to let his servants work for the
magician.
<br><br>Fig. 24: Andimo - colour of sign: black -like Erami, has an affection
for human beings. He is well informed about everything
that takes place in caves, grottos, subterranean waters, coal mines
etc. His special commission is to give shelter and assistance to all
those people that are under the earth and have to work there. He
is a great friend of all miners. A magician who is in his favour will
always be protected by Andimo, no matter whereever under the
earth he may be. Since he is well acquainted with alchemy he may
also assist, theoretically and practically, the magician in this
respect. My own experience makes me point out to every magician
that Andimo may easily tempt him to project physically,
either directly by himself or by the help of one of his subjects, a
burning stone, the so-called "living sulphur". If, in such a case,
the magician, during the projection of the stone, takes the stone
into his hand, he will get badly burned by it. Andimo likes to
place such stones before the magician's feet or before the magic
circle. You must leave this stone untouched and order Andimo to
take it away again. If the magician touches the burning sulphur
transmuted by Andimo from the principle of the earth, (i.e
prepared by methods of alchemy), with the sign of Andimo's
seal,which he earlier drew on a second piece of parchment and
had magically prepared, the parchment with the sign of the seal
will catch fire and the sulphur stone at once turn into the true
alchemical projection powder of a red colour, the so-called "red
lion". This powder then is quite safe and may be gathered up
with a glass spoon and stored away in a well shut-up glass. This
kind of projection powder usually has a projection capacity of 1 :
10.000 and is the philosopher's stone in its purest form. However,
the magician may then be tempted to use this powder for making
gold or prolonging his own life. If the magician is misled by such
temptations he would conclude, by such alchemical operations, a
formal pact with the said being. The magician is therefore warned
in advance not to do such a rashness and never to practise
alchemy in such a manner. Not even in case he assumes that he is
mature and experienced enough in everything that has to do with
the science of magic, for he might, nevertheless, be misled to take
an ill-considered step. When dealing personally with Andimo I
had the opportunity of convincing myself of these facts, but I
ordered Andimo to take the powder back to his own kingdom.
At that moment it disappeard at once, with a hissing sound.
<br><br>As far as the beings of the airy-element are concerned, also eight
names of heads, together with the signs of their seals, will be given
here. They are:
<br><br>Fig. 25: Parahim, Fig. 26: Apilki Fig. 27: Erkeya,Fig. 28: Dalep,
Fig. 29: Capisi, Fig. 30: Drisophi, Fig. 31: Glisi Fig. 32: Cargoste.
However, I desist from giving any closer description of these intelligences
for the simple reason that beings of the air are, apart
from being very shy, not at all pleased with men. It takes much effort
to force them down and only a genuine magician will succeed
in getting them entirely under his control. The things that the
airy beings taught me were later also communicated by any head
of the zone girdling the earth. The reader will be given more information
on this zone and its beings in the second chapter of the
hierarchy. Each magician is able to find the evidence for these
statements by his own practical experience.
<br>*
<br>The eight beings of the earth element mentioned above may be
enough for the magician, for he is able to gather individual experience
by his own practical work. However, I must point out
again to every magician that he must not be the first to start the
conversation with a being that is being evoked for the first time.
Furthermore, it must be mentioned here that every being appears
in a different way. I have desisted from describing each being's
colour, height, shape and way of speaking, for it would be of little
value to the practising magician. It could even happen that due to
a full description the magician, at the moment of evocation, could
be deluded by his power of imagination, and, in consequence,
would create an elemental instead of evoking the actual being.
Such an elemental would then take on the shape of the being. In
order to prevent this no details have been given here about the
outer appearance of any being. The genuinely prepared magician
will never be misled by hallucinations and will not create phantoms
or anything of that sort. If he has done the necessary
magical preparations well, he will always get the true being under
his control and will see it, hear it, and feel it.
<br><br><strong>2. Some Original Intelligences of the Zone Girdling the Earth<A name=original></A></strong>
<br><br>As soon as the magician practising ritual magic has become true
master of the beings of the elements he may take a further step in
his magical development and start dealing with the next sphere,
with the zone girdling the earth, (i. e. the mental-astral sphere of
our planet). Many beings abide in this earth-zone or zone girdling
the earth, with whom the magician can get in touch in order to
increase his knowledge and to strengthen his power. Out of this
sphere I again name in the following those beings with whom I
have been in connection a long time ago. The magician can of
course establish a connection with other beings of this sphere by
mental and astral wandering too.
<br><br>Fig. 1: Aschmunadai - is a powerful initiate in the zone girdling
the earth. He has the rank of an absolute monarch. His universal
seal, as shown in picture 1, is very complicated, but is a graphical
representation of all the fundamental qualities with which this
high intelligence is equipped with regard to the zone girdling the
earth and also with regard to our physical world. For the first
evocation this seal has to be drawn in blue, red, green and yellow
colours and has to be placed into the triangle outside the magic
circle in front of the magician. As soon as he has been able to contact
Aschmunadai he will get from him an abbreviated sign (see
Fig. 2/8) by the help of which the magician will be able to call the
intelligence. This simplified sign of Aschmunadai's seal must not
be used unless approved by Aschmunadai. Aschmunadai can make the magician
acquainted with all laws
governing the mental and astral sphere of the zone girdling the
earth and enable him to apply these laws. With Aschmunadai's
help the magician can get under his control the total zone girdling
the earth and gain plenty of knowledge. Since Aschmunadai is in
possession of a great number of servants, he can place at the magician's
disposal, if asked by him, servants who will assist him
either in the zone girdling the earth or in our physical world and
do everything he wants.
<br><br>Fig. 2: Aladiah - and Fig. 3: Kolorom - are Aschmunadai's
representatives and his first subjects. The signs for their seals have to
be drawn in black colour for their first evocation. Aladiah has an excellent
control over the elements of the zone girdling the earth. To make this evident
I should like to point out Fig. 4, i. e. Gibora, and to say that
during my former contact with Aladiah I was given by him both,
name and seal, to control gales and thunderstorms. When pronouncing
the name of Gibora and drawing the sign into the air
with the magic hand Aladiah will enable the magician to calm at
once all gales, thunderstorms and heavy winds. Of course, this sign
does not become magically effective unless the contact has been
taken up with Aschmunadai and his two representatives.
<br><br>Fig. 5: Siilla - (colour of the sign: green) is another head of the
zone girdling the earth and can explain to the magician all symbols,
i. e. he teaches the magician to understand perfectly the symbolic
language of forms. If the magician has a good command of
the symbolic language of solid forms, he knows, also, the
analogous connection of each form with the universal laws and
therefore also with the Akasha-principle.
<br><br>Fig. 6: Lilitha - (Colour of sign: red) is a female original intelligence
of the zone girdling the earth, like Aschmunadai,
knows all magic practices in respect of that sphere as well as in
respect of our planet.
<br><br>Fig. 7: Asamarc - (colour of the sign: red and blue), being an
original intelligence of the zone girdling the earth, controls the
true legality, i. e. the laws of analogy of the zone girdling the
earth and of the physical world and he can teach the magician
about this. Being a high intelligence, he can make the magician acquainted
with the highest knowledge of the zone girdling the
earth and at the same time teach him how to make practical use of
this knowledge.
<br><br>Fig. 8: The simplified sign of Aschmunadai's seal.
<br><br>Fig. 9: Emuel - (colours of his sign: red, blue, black) can explain to
the magician the synthesis of the Positive and Negative in respect
of propagation, i. e. reveal to him the original secret of life.
<br><br>Fig. 10: Ubiveh - (colours of sign: red and blue) informs the
magician about how the influences of the Moon sphere work on
the zone girdling the earth and on our physical world, mentally,
astrally and physically.
<br><br>Fig. 11: Asael - (colours of sign: red, blue and green) introduces
the magician to the electric and magnetic oscillations of the zone
girdling the earth and helps him understand and control the influences
of these oscillations on our physical world. This in-
telligence also makes the magician acquainted with the true electric
and magnetic fluids in the mental and physical world and
teaches him how to apply them correctly. Asael is an expert in
producing electromagnetic volts for certain purposes and may
give the magician the respective instructions.
<br><br>Fig. 12: Gojel - (colours of sign: red, black and green) is a
specialist in the chemical composition of all things created. The
magician may learn much from this intelligence about the various
chemical compounds, powers and so on and the practical application
for the magical knowledge.
<br><br>Fig. 13: Armiel - (colours of sign: red, blue and black) knows
about all alchemical processes. He can teach the magician the
secrets of the transmutations of metals, that is he can, for instance,
inform him how the philosopher's stone is to be made in a
dry process and what preparations are necessary for this.
<br><br>Fig. 14: Amuthim - (colours of sign: red, blue and green)
teaches the magician how to transform any shape magically into
another shape, that is, he can reveal to the magician the secrets of
de-materialization and materialization of objects.
<br><br>Fig. 15: Coel - (colours of sign: red and blue) acquaints the
magician with the law of analogies of the animal kingdom and
teaches him how to magically influence animals by force of the
laws of analogies.
<br><br>Fig. 16: Yod-He-Vau-He - (colours of sign: red, blue and green) shows the magician
the symbolic representation of the electric and magnetic influence
in respect of its effect on the zone girdling the earth. Any
being of the zone girdling the earth can make the magician acquainted
with this symbolism of the influences on the threedimensional
world. However, if the magician meditates deeply
enough on this sign he will by himself find the explanation for
the symbolic analogies.
<br><br>Fig. 17: Aeoiu - (colours of sign: red, blue and green) teaches the
magician who has placed himself into the zone girdling the earth
to draw the powers of electric and magnetic tides in a threedimensional
manner from other spheres into the zone girdling
the earth and from there into the physical world. This intelligence
knows how to charge any object in a three-dimensional
manner with the said powers and teaches the magician how to do
it.
<br><br>Fig. 18: Juoea - (colours of sign: red, blue, green and violet)
shows the magician how to penetrate the consciousness and subconsciousness
of any being and how to get control over it.
<br><br>Fig. 19: Nahum - (colours of sign: red, blue and violet) reveals
to the magician a special magical practice by which he can put to
sleep any being, man or animal, of both sexes. He is an excellent
expert of hypnosis. The magician is taught by him or his servants
how to cause dreams or visions with any male at will.
<br><br>Fig. 20: lmmicat - (colours of sign: red and green) is, contrary
to Nahum, who is regarded as the master over the world of
dream, a female intelligence of the zone girdling the earth. She informs
the magician of the method of putting a human being into
a refreshingly dreamless sleep at his, the magician's will. He may
also employ Immicat herself or one of her servants in order to
bring about the above effect in respect of any type of human being.
Immicat is the mistress and ruler of sleep. She can inform the
magician about everything that is connected or has to do with
sleep. In the case of narcosis or deep unconsciousness the intelligence
will offer the magician protection so that he can be sure
that he will awake out of such or similar states without any risks.
<br><br>Fig. 21: Osrail - (colours of sign: red and violet) is a very
powerful and frightful intelligence of the zone girdling the earth
and is regarded as the death-angel of that zone. Everything connected
with death in the zone girdling the earth as well as in the
physical world, is influenced by this intelligence. It is not wise to
evoke this intelligence. Only a highly experienced magician
should dare to do it. If he succeeds in getting Osrail under his
power, then the magician has complete control over the life and
death of any human being. However, in order not to put a heavy
moral burden on himself in the cosmic and karmic sense, the magician
will never make use of this faculty. If anyone would misuse
the sign of Osrail, this intelligence could become his destiny.
Therefore the magician must be very careful with this being. I
have only included Fig. 21 in the list in order to inform the magician
about Osrail and as a warning.
<br><br>Fig. 22: Ados - (colours of sign: red, blue, green, violet and
black) is the guard of many magical treasures. He teaches the
magician true magic with the aid of the element of the earth. He
also shows him how to make practical use of electro-magnetic
currents in the physical world in a magical manner.
<br><br>Fig. 23: Sata-Pessajah - (colours of sign: red, violet and yellow)
lets the magician know how the Akasha-principle is manifested in
all beings of the zone girdling the earth and how one can place
oneself from this sphere into the Akasha-principle, i. e. the socalled
principle of causes. Sata-Pessajah is a very powerful intelligence
and reveals to the magician many possibilities and instructions
for his protection, by means of the Akasha-principle,
against all dangers that might arise when he places himself, with
his mental and astral body, into the zone girdling the earth. At
the same time Sata-Pessajah initiates the magician into another
secret: how to make his mental and astral body invisible in the
zone girdling the earth so that he cannot be seen by any being
regardless of the sphere from where it might come. Many more
secrets can be revealed to the magician by this intelligence.
<br><br>Fig. 24: Laosa - (colours of sign: red, blue and green) is again a
female intelligence of the zone girdling the earth. She teaches the
magician how to move about freely and without any danger in
the various sub-divisions of the degrees of density. She also initiates
the magician into a special magical practice by which he
can leave, any time he likes, his physical body with his mental
and astral body in order to betake himself to the zone girdling the
earth. Laosa is an excellent initiator into the magical practices of
mental and astral wandering.
<br><br><strong>3. The 360 Heads of the Zone Girdling the Earth<A name=360></A></strong>
<br><br>These heads, which I will now describe in detail, hold in constant
harmony, in the zone girdling the earth, all actions and conditions.
Each head is a high intelligence with all the faculties that
any being of this sphere may possess. So, for instance, a magician
can be informed by any of these heads about the past, the present
and the future of our physical world, and each head, by force of
the Akasha-principle, can affect our earth. Apart from this each
head has specific qualities, i. e. is endowed with certain special
assignments. The magician need not get into touch with all of the
heads of the zone girdling the earth and at the occasion of an
evocation need only choose a certain intelligence which seems the
right one to fulfill his plans. When evoking beings from the zone
girdling the earth the magician may somewhat simplify his operations
by using quabbalistic astrology for the first evocation. Starting
from sunrise, every four minutes another head is the ruler.
<br><br>The first four minutes after sunrise are reserved for the head who
has the greatest influence on our earth. For the following four
minutes another being takes over the rule, then for the subsequent
four minutes follows the third ruler, then the fourth etc.
<br><br>During the four minutes of his reign, a head can most easily be
evoked, for at that time he is in close contact with our physical
world. An experienced magician, of course, need not bother
about the quabbalistic hour of evocation, for he is able to evoke
any being from any zone at any time.
<br><br>The description of the different shapes in which these intelligences
appear is also neglected here. In the cause of his practice
every being cited will appear to the genuine magician in the
shape appropriate to its personal character. The order of the seals
are dependent on the zodiac and their division into grades and the
influences of the elements. I shall only mention a few characteristics
of the various intelligences, for, as mentioned before, each being
and intelligence of any sphere is equipped with the usual magical
faculties. Furthermore, the magician always has the possibility of
asking an intelligence about how it may be able to help him. If an
intelligence cannot fulfill the magician's wish because its range of
influence is a different one, it will name that intelligence which is
capable of fulfilling the magician's desires.
<br>*
<br>Here are 30 heads who come under the Zodiacal Sign of Aries and
whose seals are to be drawn in red colour.
<br><br>Fig. 25: Morech (1Â° Aries) - This intelligence is very active and
impulsive. It is distinguished by an extremely strong wit. It is
very learned and cannot only supply the magician with facts of
general knowledge, but it can, above all, make him acquainted
with excellent methods to influence his memory in a favourable
manner and to increase his power of intuition. Apart from this,
Morech may help the magician with inventions of any kind in a
decisive manner. He is a ruler of the fire-element, with the help of
which he can bring about marvellous effects. Morech can inform
the magician about any questions which are connected with electricity,
no matter whether they have to do with electrotechnics or
with electrophysics, or whether astral or mental electricity, the
so-called electric fluid is meant.
<br><br>Fig. 26: Malacha (2Â° Aries) - has the same qualities as Morech
and brings about the same effects. On top of that it teaches the
magician how to move about in the kingdom of the Salamanders
and how he can operate with the powers of fire on different
planes. Furthermore, the magician may learn from Malacha in
which way certain states of trance can be brought about with the
help of the fire-element. If the magician wishes it, Malacha can
charge for him elemental volts for special purposes and transfer
them into the Akasha-principle of the zone girdling the earth,
which, in consequence, have their effects on the physical world.
Should the magician ask for it, Malacha will be pleased to place at
his disposal suitable familiar spirits with high magical activity and
magical faculties. Malacha can give good advice in respect of
Alchemy, i. e. he can procure the prima materia for the preparation
of the Great Elixier in a dry process. Many other things will
be revealed to the magician by Malacha, if the former is able to
get into contact with him.
<br><br>Fig. 27: Ecdulon (3Â° Aries) - can initiate the magician into the
magic of love. If desired by the magician he can change hostility
into friendship and secures for the magician the favour of very
important persons. This intelligence is able to charge magic mirrors
for special purposes, for instance to make the kingdom of
Salamanders visible in the mirror, and the like. Since this head is
well acquainted with all magical rites, he is able to offer the magician
various special hints with regard to the magic of evocation.
<br><br>Fig. 28: Lurchi (4Â° Aries) - can be most useful to the magician
in all love matters. He can also protect and strengthen the magician's
existence and if it is necessary, Lurchi helps the magician
become rich by showing him means and ways to reach this end or
by the direct help of his servants.
<br><br>Fig. 29: Aspadit (5Â° Aries) - is a very fine intelligence and
secures the magician's luck in games, competitions, bets and so
on. Dexterity in one's profession, in art, etc. can also be achieved
by the help of Aspadit.
<br><br>Fig. 30: Nascela (6Â° Aries) - This intelligence will help the magician
to become a talented writer or it will make him acquainted
with the methods by which he may quickly and easily develop this
talent within him. This intelligence may also help him greatly with
literature and art.
<br><br>Fig. 31: Opollogon (7Â° Aries) - This head is a custodian of
magical secrets and may reveal to the magician many practices,
rites, and so on, for his personal use. Apart from that he informs
the magician in what easy manner he can get into contact with beings
of the Moon-sphere. If the contact with Apollogon has once
been established, then one is able to roam the moon-sphere by his
personal assistance or by the help of his subordinates and get into
touch, in a special manner, with the beings of the moon-sphere.
Apollogon teaches the magician how he can practice mental
magic in the moon-sphere and have direct effects on the moonsphere
or by the beings of that sphere on our physical world.
<br><br>Fig. 32: Ramara (8Â° Aries) - is an excellent master of magic and

suitable methods, prevailingly ritual and magical formulae, and
how to apply these.
<br><br>Fig. 33: Anamil (9Â° Aries) - This intelligence has special control
over electro-magnetic fluids. It teaches the magician how to load
electro-magnetic volts for special purposes, and if the magician
demands it, it will by itself create such volts, transfer them into
the Akasha-principle and have their effects work on either the
mental, astral or physical sphere. There exists no problem in the
zone girdling the earth which could not be solved by Anamil.
The magician can ask this intelligence any question and he will
have it answered instantly by way of inspiration.
<br><br>Fig. 34: Tabori (10Â° Aries) - This intelligence allows the magician
to glimpse into the deep secrets of the water-element, and in
its analogies. It draws his attention to each of the magic practices
and methods and shows him also, by the magnetic fluid of the
water, how he can bring about various effects on himself as well
as on other persons. If the magician wants it, then Tabori causes
the effects by himself or by subordinates. Tabori will also give the
magician special instructions, for instance, how he can, without
much effort, get into contact with beings of the water-element
and how he can safely deal with them. Following Tabori' s orders,
the most beautiful undines are at the magician's disposal. From
this intelligence the magician may also learn how to calm spirits
of the storms, how to stop thunderstorms and how to tranquilize
a rough sea.

intelligence how he can procure magical authority. He is taught
how to use the powers of the earth zone at will, furthermore the
method of changing base metals into pure metals. The magician
with a specially strong disposition to magic may get this intelligence
so far as to bring about the transmutation of the metals
by itself. Bialode also introduces the magician to the magic of the
sun, that is the magician is taught how to make conscious use of
the powers of the sun in the mental, astral and physical plane on a
magical basis and also how to protect himself against negative
influences of the sun-sphere during his mental wanderings there.
<br><br>Fig. 37: Opilon (13Â° Aries) - is capable of assisting the magician
in all operations either personally or by his servants. He can furthermore
instruct the magician in any field of science of the
physical plane; that is, he can grant him knowledge.
<br><br>Fig. 38: Jrachro (14Â° Aries) - This intelligence also can by
himself or by his subordinates help the magician with all his
operations on the physical plane. Moreover it can make him eloquent
and sharp witted and at the same time teaches him how, by
means of the Akasha-principle, he can rouse this faculty within
himself as well as with others.
<br><br>Fig. 39: Golog (15Â° Aries) - This head is well acquainted with any
field of science in our physical world, and there exists no problem
which he would not be able to solve. Golog is regarded as a great
philosopher and exposes the synthesis of philosophy to the magician
by intuition and inspiration.
<br><br>Fig. 40: Argilo (16Â° Aries) - This head assists the magician,
theoretically and practically, in all questions of love and friendship
in the mental, astral and physical plane. The magician may
have all his demands in this respect fulfilled by this head.
<br><br>Fig. 41: Barnel (17Â° Aries) - Like Argilo, this intelligence is well
acquainted with the art of love and is an expert in excellent practices
which make one win the favour of friends and enemies of
both sexes. Barnal gives the magician special instructions and
makes him acquainted with special methods in respect to the
magic of sympathy. This head not only places at the magician's
disposal good beings from his own region, but also enables him to
get into touch with particular beings of the air which otherwise are
very shy of the earth and therefore hard to contact. Barnal is also
an expert in music, and if the magician desires it, he inspires him
with musical compositions, provided the magician is basically interested
in music.
<br><br>Fig. 42: Sernpolo (18Â° Aries) - Assisted by this intelligence the
magician can quickly develop his talent for languages. Sernpolo
also helps the magician improve his position in life and gives him
methodical instructions how to make practical use of the
magnetic powers within his range of effectiveness.
<br><br>Fig. 43: Hyris (19Â° Aries) - is an expert in the magic of water
with regard to the elements, to the magnetic fluid, and to bring
about effects with these powers. Hyris can reveal to the magician
many possible influences by the element of water on our physical
world and, apart from this, let him know special secrets and give
him special instructions regarding the realm of the undines.
<br><br>Fig. 44: Hahadu (20Â° Aries) - is not only well acquainted with
the magic of water, but he can also, due to his special faculties,
give the magician various instructions in respect of the preparation
of liquid fluid condensers, especially for their charging with
magnetic fluids. Hahadu is very much liked in the kingdom of the
undines, that is the element of water, and should the magician ask
for it, this head of the region of the water-element can send him as
many male and female servants as he may need for the realization
of his wishes.
<br><br>Fig. 45: Oromonas (210 Aries) - makes the magician acquainted
with various laws, powers and effects of the zone girdling the
earth. It is from Oromonas that the magician learns how to set
the various powers in motion with the help of various methods
and instructions. Oromonas is a very generous intelligence, very
friendly with human beings and at any time willing to realize the
wishes of the magician as far as it lies in his powers.
<br><br>Fig. 46: Bekaro (22Â° Aries) - By this intelligence the magician is
endowed with the knowledge and wisdom of the zone girdling
the earth, which only a few beings of that sphere are able to do.
Bekaro has a specially high interest for justice and harmony and
therefore is also able to assist the magician in the physical world
in cases where justice is involved, either in legal matters or in
other situations of life. Spirits of the storms and salamanders are
very much afraid of him, since he is capable of revealing to the
magician formulae by the application of which strong electrical and
elemental effects can be brought about in the fire region of the
zone girdling the earth, which the most stubborn salamander
spirit instantly makes submissive. If Bekaro places any being of
the salamander kingdom at the magician's disposal, such a spirit
- being of high intelligence, understanding and cleverness, will
render the magician loyal service.
<br><br>Fig. 47: Belifares (23Â° Aries) - This head, like the two foregoing
ones, is superior to the others in wisdom, cleverness and sagacity
and he teaches the magician to apply the laws of the zone girdling
the earth, by the Akasha-principle, to realize them in the
physical world. Belifares is always willing to help the magician in
any respect.
<br><br>Fig. 48: Nadele (24Â° Aries) - is especially well acquainted with
medical magnetism and reveals to the magician methods by
which the most severe diseases can be cured by magic or by any
other means. Nadele is not only a physician for the physical body
of man, but can also teach the magician how he can help himself
or any other person in any respect and in any situation of his life,
by the help of the Akasha-principle. This head is very much loved
in the kingdom of gnomes and if a magician gets into contact
with this kingdom by Nadele's assistance, even kings of gnomes
place themselves at the magician's disposal.
<br><br>Fig. 49: Yromus (25Â° Aries) - too, is an expert in magical
science, in particular a master of alchemy and spagiric. From
Yromus the magician learns how to prepare various herbs and
roots in a spagiric and alchemical manner, and how to make these
especially dynamic by the application of an electromagnetic fluid
and by a special kind of volting. If the magician so wishes he will
get instructions from Yromus how, by the Akasha-principle, to
change causes within himself or within other people so that they
have a less unfavourable influence on the mental, astral and
sometimes even physical plane. Besides this, Yromus teaches the
magician how to change a person's fate and to carry out magical
operations without their being impregnated into the Akashaprinciple
to cause contra-effects. Yromus, too, is beloved in the
kingdom of gnomes, and all gnomes, especially those of the upper
class, meet this head with the highest respect.
<br><br>Fig. 50: Hadcu (26Â° Aries) - is a master of mental and astral
magic and teaches the magician how to make practical use, in the
mental, astral and physical worlds, of extra-planetary powers for
vanous purposes.
<br><br>Fig. 51: Balachman (27Â° Aries) - is an excellent initiator into
synthetic astrology and reveals to the magician the most remote
secrets of astrology. By this initiator the magician learns about
the astrological influences on the mental and astral worlds, furthermore
the opposite oscillations and vibrations of the various
spheres with regard to the mental, astral and physical plane. The
knowledge of the cosmic effects, on the mineral, the plant, and
the animal kingdoms is also taught to the magician by this head,
either directly or by intuition and inspiration.
<br><br>Fig. 52: Jugula (28 0 Aries) - introduces the magician into the
art of talismanology. From this head the magician learns to solve
the most complicated symbols from the synthetic side. Apart
from this, Jugula teaches the magician how to express truly by the
appropriate symbol, each power and each being of the zone girdling
the earth together with its qualities, or how to shape it into
the correct graphic representation. At the same time he initiates
the magician into the secret of making such symbols magically effective
by various methods.
<br><br>Fig. 53: Secabmi (29Â° Aries) - brings about various effects on
the mental, astral, and physical plane by help of the magnetic
fluid. This head is a master of the art of producing scents and can
instruct the magician how to prepare, in the spagiric manner, not
only medicines, but also scents from various plants.
<br><br>Fig. 54: Calacha (30Â° Aries) - is the last head of this zodiacal
sign. He teaches the magician how to treat various diseases with
the element of water. Calacha is a master in hydrotherapy and is
always prepared to assist the magician, theoretically and practically,
in this field. Magicians dealing with natur opathy will find an
excellent initiator in Calacha, who can reveal to them many
secrets by intuition and inspiration, secrets which have remainded
unrevealed up to this date.
<br>*
<br>Here is the description of another 30 heads of the zone girdling
the earth. They come under the zodiacal sign of Taurus. Their
signs and seals have to be drawn in green colour.
<br><br>Fig. 55: Serap (1Â° Taurus) - is the first head of this sign. He informs
the magician about the magic of sympathy which can be
realized by the element of fire. As I have learned from personal
experience with this head, he will introduce the magician to practices
which are usually connected with the application of fluid
condensers, which after having been transferred on blotting paper
must be burnt. He likes to give the magician methodical instructions
how to procede with various magical practices for the making
of friends, for the arousing of sensations of love, improving
the power of propagation, etc. The magician may learn a lot from
this head in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 56: Molabeda (2Â° Taurus) - If the magician wants to get into
contact with this head, he will be taught by him how, by application
of the electric fluid, in connection with the element of
fire, various phenomena in nature, which are equivalent to
miracles, can be caused. Molabeda is a loyal guardian of the deep
secret mysteries of sexual life which he will only reveal to the
mature and ethically highly developed magician.
<br><br>Fig. 57: Manmes (3Â° Taurus) - is an expert of the magical
knowledge of plants. From this head the magician learns to
recognize the various plants from the hermetic point of view, and
is introduced by him into the art of bringing about various effects
by applying plants in a magical manner. Manmes draws the magician's
attention to various plants which can be used as incense
material and which can serve the magician well as an aid for
various operations.
<br><br>Fig. 58: Faluna (4Â° Taurus) - This intelligence is a very great
friend of human beings, and helps the magician, should he want
it, to wealth. It gives him various instructions how to make from
plants certain substances which are able to preserve his body, or
even to make it younger and more resistant against inharmonious
influences - diseases and the like. Faluna is an excellent instructor
for the production of spagiric substances which can be gained
from certain plants.
<br><br>Fig. 59: Nasi (5Â° Taurus) - cangivethe magician good advice,
either by himself or by his subordinates, on how he 'can make his
life agreeable and full of pleasure by various improvements. Nasi
tells the magician how to increase his income, and helps the magician
to improve his position in life either by himself or by his servants.
He is regarded as a perfect master of the making of pleasure
and earthly happiness.
<br><br>Fig. 60: Conioli (6Â° Taurus) - This head is an excellent
mathematician and an expert in the knowledge of numbers. The
magician is initiated into Astro-Quabbalah by this intelligence.
Conioli knows how to express mathematically in numbers any
power, faculty, realization etc. and, vice versa, how to explain to
the magician any number in respect of its influences and qualities.
Apart from this, Conioli teaches the magician how to make, from
the magic point of view, practical use of the knowledge gained.
<br><br>Fig. 61: Carubot (7Â° Taurus) - If the magician is a writer, this
head may assist him by intuition and inspiration with proposals
and projects for literary use and distinguished style. Magicians
dealing with fairy tales, legends, sagas and the like, find in
Carubot an excellent initiator.
<br><br>Fig. 62: Jajaregi (8Â° Taurus) - too, is a very great initiator,
especially for writers on occultism, since he knows very well how
to inspire the magician so that he is able to reproduce occult
powers, effects, laws etc. in the form of novels. Many magicians
who have published novels dealing with occultism may have been
inspired by this intelligence without having been aware of it. On
the other hand, Jajaregi is also able to explain to the magician all
occult novels, events etc. in respect of the universal laws and the
laws of cause and effect on the mental, astral and physical plane,
either personally or by his servants, or by intuition.
<br><br>Fig. 63: Orienell (9Â° Taurus) - gives information on occult aids,
auxiliary methods etc. which may contribute to the development
of various mental, astral and physical faculties. Orienell also
reveals to the magician by which manner he can acquire any certain
faculty. Such aids are mainly rites, formulae or gestures as I
know from own former practical experience with this head. If the
magician stays in contact with Orienell for a longer period of
time he can make provisional notes on all magical aids, which are
revealed to him by way of intuition by this head.
<br><br>Fig. 64: Concario (10Â° Taurus) - is an excellent master and
teacher in respect of moon-magic. He draws the magician's attention
to the various influences of the moon and the 28 stations of
the moon; furthermore how these may have mental, astral, or
physical effects on the zone girdling the earth as well as on our
physical world, and how practical use can be made of them. Concario
explains to the magician the synthesis of the astrological
magic of the moon.
<br><br>Fig. 65: Dosom (11Â° Taurus) - is a very good initiator into occultism,
especially hypnotism, medical magnetism etc. From this
head the magician learns how to apply correctly hypnosis regarding
spirit, soul and body. If the magician wants Dosom to place
any of his servants at his disposal, these servants will do all relevant
operations and bring about the effects according to the magician's
desire. These powers and faculties, however, must never be
used for ignobel purposes, for otherwise the magician would get
connected with the contra-genius.
<br><br>In order to prevent any misuse of intelligences and beings, I
have desisted from mentioning in this work the intelligences
and heads of the zone girdling the earth which represent the
negative qualities. There are as many negative heads as there
exist heads with good and positive qualities.
<br><br>Fig. 66: Galago (12 Â° Taurus) - instructs the magician how, by
impregnation of his aura, his magical space, by means of the electric
fluid and the elements of fire he can magically secure honour,
esteem, dignity, friendship and love etc.
<br><br>Fig. 67: Paguldez (13Â° Taurus) - is an excellent initiator into all
the aspects of the magic of nature. If the magician gets into touch
with this head, he learns from him, how to get going, by natural
means, various powers, how to bring about certain causes, resp.
effects which almost reach the unnatural. At the magician's
special request this head will reveal to him by which means he can
bring about various phenomena of nature. - For information I
mention here that the contra-genius is guardian of the secrets of
various sorcery projects of the magic of nature.
<br><br>Fig. 68: Pafessa (14Â° Taurus) - renders the magician professional
assistance and inspires him to improve his professional situation.
If, for instance, the magician is a businessman this head will help
him, through his employees, to get more customers etc. Pafessa is
very polite and is always pleased to help the magician in any
respect whatsoever on the physical plane. In the kingdom of
gnomes this head is very much respected, and gnomes like to
serve the magician if they have been told by Pafessa to do so.
<br><br>Fig. 69: Jromoni, (15Â° Taurus) -, being an excellent initiator, he
can inform the magician how to make money easily and quickly,
providing Divine Providence approves of it - by wins, bets, speculations
etc. Jromoni also knows where to find hidden treasures and if
he thinks it wise he can tell the magician their exact location.
However, this head knows very well, whether or not the assistance
which he is to give the magician is permissable from the karmic point
of view. If he should not give the magician the assistance he wants, he
will tell the magician so during his first evocation and will only
assist him as much as he is permitted by Divine Providence without
burdening the karma of the magician. The magician should know
that sometimes wealth, riches and surplus money may be great hindrances
on the way to perfection.
<br><br>Fig. 70: Tardoe (16Â° Taurus) - has the power to awaken in the
magician various talents - for instance talents in art, literature or
other - by suitable practices, rituals and the like, or, if the magician
has the disposition for certain talents, to develop these quickly.
If, for instance, the magician wants to make a career as an artist,
he will find in this head the initiator and assisting friend that
he needs.
<br><br>Fig. 71: Ubarim (17Â° Taurus) - initiates the magicianinto the
use of various means for the blazing up of love and friendship and
he can give the magician many methods and instructions in this
respect. At the same time the magician receives from this head
detailed instructions for the manufacture of amulets of love and
friendship. Ubarim can also charge amulets and talismans for this
purpose, either by himself or by his servants, should the magician
request it.
<br><br>Fig. 72: Magelucha (18Â° Taurus) - gives the magician various instructions
on how to operate magically with the elements of the
air and of water in the mental, astral and physical plane, and how
he can make use of these two powers to reach various goals.
Magelucha is a master of these two elements and his practices he
only reveals to the mature and genuine magician. The magician
can learn much from this head in respect of fluids and their application
for various purposes.
<br><br>Fig. 73: Chadail (19Â° Taurus) - is a true guardian of agriculture,
and, in general, he inspires not only the magician in this physical
world, but also all those people that have to do with agronomy,
agrochemistry, agricultural improvements and the like. If the
magician is a farmer, he can learn from this head how he can im-
prove his soil either by normal means or in an occult manner in
order to effect an accelerated growth of his plants; furthermore,
how by the radiations of various chemical products he can increase
the productivity of his soil in respect of quality and quantity.
He also draws the magician's attention to various labour
methods and instructs him how to achieve a better growing of
natural products by the help of the electromagnetic fluid, or
the elements, or quabbalistic methods. By the assistance of
Chadail or his servants the magician is able to get almost
phenomenal results in agriculture.
<br><br>Fig. 74: Charagi (20Â° Taurus) - This head is a marvellous inspirer
of technical inventions for agricultural and forestry purposes.
If the magician gets into contact with Charagi, he can acquire
much experience by this intelligence or by its servants in
the above mentioned fields.
<br><br>Fig. 75: Hagos: (21Â° Taurus) - is a master of the magic of
polarisation and electric fluid. He instructs the magician how to
bring about an accelerated growth of plants by the magic of
polarisation in connection with the electric fluid, how, for instance,
he has to proceed in order that a seed which has just been
planted grows into a tree with fruits within an hour.
Fakirs who are able to grow a tree from a seed within an hour
- this miracle is known in India as the so-called true miracle of
the mango-tree - do this by means of their knowledge of the
magic of polarisation and of the electric fluid. Such a thing is no
secret for the magician, and I have already mentioned in "Initiation
into Hermetics" that this phenomenon is brought about by
the application of the electromagnetic fluid, by the application of
the magic of polarisation. I mention this here because the magician
may be enabled by Hagos or his servants to create the same
phenomenon.
<br><br>Fig. 76: Hyla (22Â° Taurus) - can help the magician acquire a
clear mind, good power of judgement, sagacity and cleverness
through the channels of high intuition and inspiration. He can
help the magician either personally or by one of his servants with
various affairs, for instance, with examinations in diverse fields of
science in this physical world, and more of that sort.
<br><br>Fig. 77: Camalo (24Â° Taurus) - is, apart from having other
faculties and ranges of effectivity, very well acquainted with the
secrets of mineral compounds and their occult application, and he
guards these secrets well. Above all, he informs the magician
about the analogies of various metals to the spheres, powers, individual
spirits etc. and how these powers can be magically made
use of in the mental, astral and physical world. If requested by the
magician, he will reveal a number of formulae for the making of
fluid condensers, and also for the true Electromagicum which is
used for various purposes; thus for instance, for the manufacture
of a magic mirror, wand etc. Naturally, the magician also learns
from this head in which manner these fluid condensers are to be
charged for magical use and various purposes in the zone girdling
the earth and in our physical world.
<br><br>Fig. 78: Baalto (25Â° Taurus) - informs the magician on the
various kinds of work in mines. He supervises the gnomes of the
underworld of our planet and knows about all the subterranean
waters and ores. He can also give the magician information on
volcanos and tell him the exact moment of their eruptions.
Besides this, Baalto can give him methods and instructions on
how to use magically, for the most various purposes, the currents
existing below the surface of the earth. If requested, he will introduce
to the magician the art of working with a divining rod
and the appliance of the sideric pendulum regarding its faculty for
finding electromagnetic currents as well as a great number of
other things of this nature.
<br><br>Fig. 79: Camarion (23Â° Taurus) - By this head the magician will
be informed of the magic relations between the various kinds of
food from the point of view of health and the harmony of the
body. Camarion instructs the magician which food he should
choose, whether fruits or prepared compound meals, in order to
adhere to the occult laws of analogies. Through the channels of intuition
and inspiration the magician is revealed by Camarion how
foods and meals are to be charged, what fluid, electric or
magnetic, is to be used, or what elements have to be employed to
bring about a certain effect on the mental, astral or physical body.
He is an excellent inspirer with regard to diet - especially in
respect of diseases of any kind, i. e. disharmonies of body, soul and
spirit. He is always prepared to give the magician his assistance.
<br><br>Fig. 80: Amalomi (26Â° Taurus) - This high inspirer is regarded
as the cosmic language teacher. By him the magician is instructed
how to use Quabbalah, that is the cosmic language with reference
to the physical world. Amalomi initiates the magician into many
formulae and Tantras, and, at the same time, teaches him how to
dynamise these in order to bring about effects by force of the
Akasha-principle in the mental, astral and physical world.
I shall make mention in my third work entitled "The Key to
the True Quabbalah" of some formulae, methods and the like,
which this head has permitted me to publish.
<br><br>Fig. 81: Gagison (27Â° Taurus) - This head is regarded - in the
zone girdling the earth - as a universal philosopher. By intuition
he makes the magician comprehend all religious systems of this
physical world of the past and the present, as well as their true
legality. The magician who is a friend of this head can learn a
great deal from him and get to the bottom of any religious system
that he wants to scrutinize from the hermetic point of view, and
find the universal laws effective in it. At the same time he realizes
to what extent universal laws have been hidden, veiled or
misunderstood, and may correct these errors from the
philosophical point of view for his personal use. Philosophy of
religion will teach him how to separate the chaff from the wheat.
If the magician contacts Gagison often, he will soon see that from
the days of yore all religious systems have been following the
universal laws like Ariadne's thread and that up to the present
day these laws are more or less strongly manifested in any
religious system.
<br><br>Fig. 82: Carahami (28Â° Taurus) - This head could rightly be
called the teacher of cosmic universal physics. He makes the
magician understand the cosmic powers, their analogies and their
legality in nature, and teaches him how to control them.
Carahami can reveal to the magician many metaphysical and
metapsychic secrets in regard to nature. Phenomena that have
become clear to the magician in their causes and effects due to his
growing knowledge of cosmic powers do not leave him in any
doubt, and he not only finds the correct explanation for any
natural phenomenon, looking at it from the hermetic angle, but,
depending on his personal maturity he is able to bring about such
phenomena by himself. A true magician, however, will never
dare to cause any chaos by magical operations of this sort, for he
would only heavily burden his Karma by doing so.
<br><br>Fig. 83: Calamos (29Â° Taurus) - can reveal to the magician excellent
methods for the grafting of plants in our physical world.
But since he has a great affection for the sea and the lives in the
sea, he can, apart from that, name the magician special magical
methods by which he gets under his power and controls
everything that lives in the water. Calamos can inform the magician
of magic spells which will calm the rough sea, and also teach
him how to protect himself during voyages. In the case of danger,
when a ship with the total crew is likely to sink, a magician who
is in connection with Calamos will always be able to find a way
for the rescue. If the magician requests it, Calamos will also place
at his disposal elemental beings of the sea, or he will instruct him
how to get into contact with beings of the sea. Undines, dwelling
near lonely beaches, and all subterranean beings highly esteem
this head of the zone girdling the earth, and meet him with the
greatest possible awe, fulfilling at once anything that he may
order or desire.
<br><br>Fig. 84: Sapasani (30Â° Taurus) - like Calamos, is an excellent
master of the magic of water. All being living in the water and all
elemental beings obey this head. His special knowledge is connected
with the use of sea salt for purposes and operations of
alchemy and magic. The magician is informed by Sapasani how
he can get into touch with water beings in a sympathetic manner
by using a small punch of sea salt, how he can make useful, for
various purposes, the powers of the elemental beings of the sea,
and he is initiated into many other practices by this head of the
zone girdling the earth.
<br>*
<br>The seals of the following thirty heads of the zone girdling the earth
which belong to the zodiacal sign of Gemini must all be drawn in
brown.
<br><br>Fig. 85: Proxones (1Â° Gemini) - The magician will be given exact
information by this head on all questions dealing with the
electric fluid and its relation to the mental, astral and physical
planes. Proxones is regarded master of the electric fluid and
therefore also master of electricity. At the same time he is the
special guardian of inventions, and, as far as these are concerned
with the basics of electricity, he keeps them in the right
equilibrium. All people dealing with inventions in the field of
electricity are accordingly inspired by Proxones. He will tell the
discreet magician of inventions which will be made after many
years, or even after many centuries. Of course, the magician is not
allowed to publish these inventions, but he will hear from Proxones
what periods of time it will take technicians to make progress
in the field of electricity and can accumulate great
knowledge in this respect. With Proxones's permission the magician
may make use of some secrets, but only for himself, for this
must in no case result in a chaos of the orderliness of the worlds.
<br><br>Fig. 86: Yparcha (2Â° Gemini) - is, like the foregoing head, also
in charge of the custody of technical inventions. Yparcha, too,
can tell the magician under the seal of secrecy what progress the
world will have made in fifty, in a hundred or in even more years
than that as far as technical inventions are concerned. Should the
magician be working on some invention himself, he has with
Yparcha the best inspirer for providing him, by intuition, with
good ideas.
<br><br>Fig. 87: Obedomah (3Â° Gemini) - This intelligence informs the
magician about all branches of chemistry, biology, etc. in their
relation to metaphysics and metapsychology. Thus, for instance,
the magician may get from Obedomah recipes for the treatment
of various diseases which are due to analogous chemical and
biochemical connections, which have quite a different range of
diagnoses and effectivity than the chemical qualities of any
separate substance have. This head can also give the magician excellent
information on homoeopathy from the metaphysical
point of view. By the help of Obedomah the magician also
becomes acquainted with the application of chemical rays in
respect of the various analogous laws of nature and of man in the
microcosm as well as the macrocosm.
<br><br>Fig. 88: Padidi (4Â° Gemini) - is the inspirer of the painters of
our physical world. If the magician deals with painting, this head
is able to let the magician know compositions, by the way of intuition
and inspiration, of which the magician himself has no idea
at all. Padidi teaches the magician, depending on his degree of
maturity, to express genuine beauty. To project beauty which
corresponds to the analogous laws of the microcosm and the
macrocosm outside of oneself, is a great art which can only be
brought to perfection in the case of inborn originality. However,
if the magician is in contact with Padidi, this rare art will be embodied
into him by this intelligence, which, apart from this, can
reveal to the magician many secrets concerning the composition
of colours.
<br><br>Fig. 89: Peralit (5Â° Gemini) - This head is a great master in the
knowledge of life and death. From him the magician may learn at
what time a child should be procreated on this earth to become
endowed with certain faculties. Peralit teaches the magician how
to generate a baby consciously in the magic manner and gives him
special instructions for the education of the baby before its actual
birth, which enables the magician to supply the child, before it is
born, with certain qualities, faculties and talents. The magician is
also informed by Peralit which spirit of the zone girdling the
earth is going to be borne with the baby generated by him, and
what fate and Karma it will have. At the same time this intelligence
informs the magician how he can help his child during
life-time, what role he is to take, not only as father, but, if
necessary, also as teacher, and the like. Since Peralit is an excellent
initiator into the mysteries of sex, he can easily explain these to
the magician.
<br><br>Fig. 90: Isnirki (6Â° Gemini) - informs the magician of methods
and instructions by which he can comprehend the mental and the
astral sphere of each animal, no matter whether it lives on the
earth, in the water or in the air, and which help him to understand
their worlds. By this head he acquires the faculty of placing
himself, with his full consciousness, into the mental and astral
sphape of any animal, and by doing this he learns to understand
any animal from these two states of consciousness and to influence
it, if necessary, according to his own will. This helps him
also to acquire the faculty of knowing the fate of each animal.
Assisted by Isnirki, the magician can place himself into the relevant
sphere of the group of animals in which each animal comes
after its death in this physical world, and there he can take up certain
connections if he likes. Magicians who at the same time are
great lovers of animals may learn much from Isnirki in this
respect.
<br><br>Fig. 91: Morilon (7Â° Gemini) - This head is a marvellous initiator
and master of symbolism. By pointing out various
methods to the magician, he teaches him how to gain the faculty
of expressing every outside form, in this physical world, by symbols
in its mental and astral equivalencies analogous to the laws of
the microcosm and macrocosm. At the same time he learns from
Morilon the faculty of how to express any law, any quality,
regardless from whatever sphere, by an exterior shape. In possession
of this faculty, the magician can become an interpreter of
dreams, for he is then able to explain any dream.
By being able to learn about the symbols of the analogies the
magician also learns to understand completely any being appearing
to him in any sphere whatsoever. A magician endowed with
these faculties will never be deceived by any being, for it will
always have to take on the shape of its true qualities.
<br><br>Fig. 92: Golema (8Â° Gemini) - may be called an excellent
philosopher of occultism, for not only does this head know all
the laws of our world and of the zone girdling the earth, but he is
also able - should the magicianget into contact with him - to
teach the faculty of expressing the most difficult problems in our
physical language, that is in the language of the intellect. How difficult
it sometimes is to express in words occult and philosophical
themes so that they become comprehensible also for the noninitiate,
is only realized by magicians who are writers on occultism
or teachers and advisers in this field. With Golema the
magician has the. best inspirer he can find, who, by way of intuition
and inspiration, will help him to express any problem in
such a way that any misunderstanding will be impossible. The
magician with a bad memory or bad faculty of perception can, by
Golema's methods or direct assistance, acquire the contrary, i. e. a
very good memory and an excellent faculty of perception.
<br><br>Fig. 93: Timiran (9Â° Gemini) - This head is an excellent expert
in the laws of harmony, not only in respect of the zone girdling
the earth, but also in respect of the whole microcosm and
macrocosm. He can make the magician understand the harmony
in our physical world and in the zone girdling the earth from the
hermetic point of view. Timiran explains to the magician the true
meaning of introspection and the way in which the magical
equilibrium is applied. If the magical secrets of introspection are
quite clear to the magician, he can achieve, due to his acquired
knowledge and faculties, a complete harmony not only in
himself, but also in other people, and he can create, at any time,
harmony and equilibrium in all cases in which he wants to do so,
and in which the influences of chaos or disharmony are obvious.
Only few magicians are in possession of these faculties, and this
head, Timiran, can help the magician a great deal in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 94: Golemi (10Â° Gemini) - this head, similar to the foregoing,
is also an excellent expert in all laws of analogy, i. e. not only
in respect of this physical world and the zone girdling the earth,
but also in respect of all other spheres. Benefitted with Golemi's
inspiration and intuitional assistance the magician learns how to
evaluate correctly the beings of any sphere and plane. He learns
to recognize the range of effectiveness of each being which has
been attributed to it by Divine Providence, so that in the presence
of the magician no being is able to maintain to know anything
that in fact is not so. Furthermore, the magician is taught by
Golemi to classify and indentify any being from its outside appearance
such as colour, tone, shape, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 95: Darachin (11Â° Gemini) - The magician is taught by this
head how to penetrate and influence the brains and the intellect
of a man in a most subtle manner. If the magician wants it,
Darachin will give him appropriate instructions and show him
methods which will enable him to embody himself in the intellectual
faculties of any person and to be active in somebody else's
state of consciousness. This faculty makes the magician master
over the brains and intellect of any human being. He can, should
he want it and regard it as necessary, improve or diminish the intellectual
faculties of a person. Thus he can, for instance, either
awaken pictures of the past in a certain person or he can influence
them in a manner that they completely disappear from the
memory of that person. However, Darachin will only reveal such
specific methods and instructions to magicians with a genuinely
high degree of ethics. To be in possession of the above mentioned
faculties means being able to know, at any time, everything that
any other person knows.
<br><br>Fig. 96: Bagoloni (120 Gemini) - has a special predilection for
telepathy, for thought transference, and is an excellent master in
this respect. He gives the magician appropriate instructions and
methods which help the latter acquire these faculties. The magician
following the special instructions of this head is able to
transfer any picture to some other person, either by vision,
acoustics or through the person's consciousness. At the same time
he acquires the faculty of arousing, in the astral body of any other
human being, - not aquainted with magic - special qualities of
character.
<br><br>Fig. 97: Paschy (13Â° Gemini) - This head can assist the magician
in being a successful diplomat. He can reveal to the magician who
is a diplomat the way to fortune in his diplomatic career by, for
instance, unveiling to him certain top secrets which are only
known to a few diplomats. In difficult diplomatic matters the
magician, being in connection with Paschy, may be inspired by
this head, so that eventually he has full success. This intelligence
may justly be called the head of the diplomats.
<br><br>Fig. 98: Amami (14Â° Gemini) helps the magician with philosophical
literature, or he helps him to get hold of the right
books or other literature. In general, the magician need not
bother about books, for anything that interests him or that he
must know about in the field of philosophy, or any other field of
the arts, he can get directly from the beings or by their communication.
However, it sometimes happens that a magician is a
great lover of books and that for him the collection of books is
more a matter of personal affection than a matter of learning. If
the magician is fond of books, there is no reason why he should
not ask Amami to assist him in this respect. This head will in no
way disappoint the magician.
<br><br>Fig. 99: Pigios (15Â° Gemini) - If the magician is a writer, he will
find a true friend and adviser with this head, who will assist him
at any time by force of inspiration. He especially likes to help
poets by inspiration and to assist them in choosing the right
words and expressions. Pigios is justly regarded as the head of all
poets and writers.
<br><br>Fig. 100: Cepacha (16Â° Gemini) - has a special affection for
beauty, harmony and external splendour. If requested by the
magician, this head is always prepared to initiate him into the
various mysteries of beauty care and he will tell him ways and
means by which he can make his body look good-looking and attractive.
Magicians with a sense for beauty with special emphasis
on their external appearance will find an excellent inspirer in this
head.
<br><br>Fig. 101: Urgivoh (17Â° Gemini) - assists the magician,
theoretically and practically, in gaining the favour of very important
persons. He also instructs the magician how to become liked
by women or men, whichever seems necessary for him. If the
magician follows precisely these instructions without doing
things according to his individual views he will always have full
success in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 102: Amagestol (18Â° Gemini) - initiates the magician into
the secrets of love, into its legality, its causes and effects, no matter
whether lowest animal love or highest cosmic love is in question.
Amagestol is the guardian genius of all beings who love each
other on earth.
<br><br>Fig. 103: Debam (19Â° gemini) - is a master of magic, especially
in the field of gesticulation and individual ritualistics. Should the
magician be in need of any ritual for individual purposes, this
head will give him the best advice. From Debam the magician
learns how to make full use of any p~wer of any sphere by help of
the appropriate gesticulation and, above that, how to put into ac-
tion certain powers of all three planes by appropriate gesticulations.
<br><br>Fig. 104: Kolani (20Â° Gemini) - is the initiator in respect to occult
dancing, especially in respect to dances with the purpose of
putting into action certain powers, or of getting into contact with
them. This head can reveal to the magician, by intuition, dances
which arouse in man certain extraordinary faculties. If the magician
wants to place himself into mental ecstasy by occult dances,
Kolani will give him the necessary advice.
<br><br>Fig. 105: Mimosah (21Â° Gemini) - All people dealing with law
are under the care and supervision of this head of the zone girdling
the earth. If this head is called for in any legal matter with an
unjust sentence or settlement, either Mimosah himself or someone
of his subordinates will render the magician help. Therefore
it is only right to regard this head as the guardian of all human
rights. All judges, lawyers etc. who have to do with legal affairs,
can, should they be magicians, refer to this intelligence at any time.
<br><br>Fig. 106: Eneki (22Â° Gemini) - This head can, in the most
diverse ways, initiate the magician into the art of prophecy and
prediction. Eneki provides the magician in this respect with
sagacity and high intuition. If a magician gets into contact with
this intelligence, he will be taught to control all kinds of foretelling,
chieromancy, graphology, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 107: Corilon (23Â° Gemini) - This head is the guardian and
assistant of all artists working for the public, no matter whether
singers, stage actors, circus-artists, virtuosos etc. If this head is
evoked, he will assist everybody by inspiration, in the above
quoted direction, to display his art or work to everybody's complete
satisfaction. Corilon makes professional artists very much
loved by the audience and also secures their financial success. In
case the magician is a stage-artist himself, orin case he wants to
assist somebody else theoretically and practically, then he should
refer confidently to this head, who will fulfill his wish at any
time.
<br><br>Fig. 108: Ygarimi (24Â° Gemini) - has been commissioned to explain
to the magician all causes in the mental, astral or physical
plane registered in the Akasha-principle. Therefore, if the magician
has good connections with this head he' will be taught by
him how causes which have been conjured up by thoughts, feelings,
qualities of character, physical actions etc. are to be differed
from each other in the Akasha-principle. Furthermore, how,
from these causes in the Akasha-principle, fate in the mental,
astral and physical plane can be reliably predicted. If the magician
learns to make these differences, he will be able to predict hindrances
which later will occur in the mental, astral and physical
world. This head, Ygarimi, will show the magician means and
ways of diminishing such hindrances, sometimes even how to
eliminate them completely.
<br><br>Fig. 109:Jamaih (25Â° Gemini) - This head may be regarded, by
the magician, as an expert in the history of religions, for he can
inform him thoroughly on all religions which exist in our world
or which have already ceased to exist He can do this from the
esoteric as well as from the exoteric point of view. This intelligence
also initiates the magician into the esoteric knowledge
of the oldest religious sects.
<br><br>Fig. 110: Bilifo (26Â° Gemini) - This head is in charge of the
custody of all magic and mystical circles, associations and sects
so that one may call him their legal guardian. He decides on the
creation, maintenance and decay of such associations. A discrete
magician may get detailed information on magic and mystic
lodges and all secrets by this head without being himself a
member of such or similar associations, brotherhoods etc. He
will, of course, keep the information and knowledge gained to
himself for his own personal use.
<br><br>Fig. 111: Mafalach (27Â° Gemini) - helps the magician to solve
any difficult problem by supplying him, either by himself or by
any of his subordinates, with suitable books, manuscripts, and the
like. If, for instance, the magician is completely selfdependant and
if he is operating quite alone, i. e. without the help of a teacher or
initiator, this head may also assist him by introducing him,
sooner or later, to a human being who will become the magician's
true master. The quality of the teacher depends, in each case, on
the quality and maturity of the seeking person.
<br><br>Fig. 112: Kaflesi (28Â° Gemini) - Being an excellent initiator, this
head will initiate the magician into the secret analogies, i. e. into
the laws of analogies of the microcosm and macrocosm. Thus the
magician will learn from this head all laws of analogy in respect to
the body, soul and spirit and their relation to the universe and
how to make practical use of this knowledge.
<br><br>Fig. 113: Sibolas (29Â° Gemini) - again informs the magician
contrarily by explaining to him thoroughly the true connection
of all exoteric, i. e. worldly matters, with the genuine laws of
analogy and by teaching him how to draw the attention of the
higher powers on him by external matters and events, sometimes
even how to put them into action. The magician may learn much
from this head, especially in respect of the magic of nature.
<br><br>Fig. 114: Seneol (30Â° Gemini) - The last head under this sign of
the zodiac is the protector of all human beings who do
watersports. He may help the magician by making him acquire,
by appropriate methods and instructions, extraordinary faculties
in sports; for instance, records in speed and distance swimming,
in swimming under water etc. He can also help the magician with
the rescue of people who are in danger of drowning. If somebody
is missing, i. e. if people assume he or she has been drowned,
Seneol or his subordinates will show the magician the place
where the body can be found. If the magician has a good connection
with this head, he will never in his life be in danger of drowning,
for Seneol sees to it that the magician is rescued in every
case.
<br>*
<br>The following thirty heads come under the zodiacal sign of
Cancer of the zone girdling the earth; their seals have to be drawn
in a silvery-white colour.
<br><br>Fig. 115: Nablum (1Â° Cancer) - will be pleased to inform the
magician, by inspiration and intuition, on the various degrees of
warmth - temperature - in respect of alchemic or spagiric
methods. However, since these not only playa role in the
preparation of plants and metals, but also other fluids, for instance
light, colour, tone, oscillation etc., the magician may also be informed
by him on these things. Nablum is an expert in alchemic
and spagiric operations, and the magician can profit much in this
respect by his inspirations.
<br><br>Fig. 116: Nudatoni (2Â° Cancer) - The magician, being in connection
with this head, gets from him closer information on the
eruptions of volcanos on our physical world and on the earthquakes
with them. Nudatoni can inform the magician in advance
when a volcanic mountain will throw out lava. Nudatoni, or his
servants, can, if requested, accompany the magician on his mental
or astral wanderings into places deep under the earth to show him
hot springs, caves with stalactities, hidden treasures or anything
else which is to be found under the surface of the earth. This head
is at the same time a very good initiator into the science of
pyrotechnics, especially as far as operations with the electric and
magnetic fluids are concerned, and he informs the magician how
to bring about various pyrotechnical miracles in a magic manner
with these fluids.
<br><br>Fig. 117:Jachil (3Â° Cancer) - knows about all erotic secrets and
can initiate the magician into them. He is always prepared to furnish
the magician with many magical means by which love can be
aroused or diminished. Apart from this, he informs the magician
how he can, by the force of magic, make himself beloved by and
attractive to the other sex, and how one may become effective
from the erotic point of view. He will, if he wishes, be informed
by this intelligence on the most secret arts of sex magic.
<br><br>Fig. 118: Helali (4Â° Cancer) - This head is an excellent initiator
into sympathy-mummial magic. He can give information on
how, with the help of the elements, the magician practising mummial
magic can bring about various effects, and he can apart from
that, explain to the magician the influence of the electric and
magnetic fluids on nature. Helali introduces the magician into
special working methods which have not been known to anyone
up to now and which have to do with mummial magic. The
special mummial-magic instructions given by him or by his servants
can help the magician bring about effects which he would
have never thought of.
<br><br>Fig. 119: Emfalion (5Â° Cancer) - advises the magician on how
he can get a strong and healthy constitution, a handsome, attractive
face, fascinating eyes, i. e. the freshness of youth which he
will preserve into advanced age. From Emfalion the magician gets
the necessary instructions for the preparation of substances by
which he can so impregnate his body that it will not decay. If a
magician has a good connection with this head, he will be given
the appearance of a youth, though he may already be rather old,
or he may at least always give his fellow-men the impression that
he is but a middle-aged gentleman. Also the preparation of magic
elixirs from various plants for special magic purposes will be fully
revealed to the magician by this intelligence.
<br><br>Fig. 120: Pliroki (6Â° Cancer) - explains to the magician the actual
facts about the so-called "message through the air" which is
especially well known in the East. He tells the magician, should
he wish it, about suitable methods in which he is an expert, so
that finally the magician will also be able to send messages to far
off people, no matter whether they are initiates or not. The magician
is taught by this head to make this phenomenon work on the
mental and astral, and sometimes even on the physical plane by
help of the electro-magnetic fluid and the air element, or by the
help of beings, spirits, and the like. The magician will also be able
to bring about other magical phenomena by the help of Pliroki.
<br><br>Fig. 121: Losimon (7Â° Cancer) - informs the magician on the
original mysteries and original systems of the religious beliefs of
the oldest peoples of the world and also on the magic phenomena
which the people of the times past, especially their high priests,
were able to create. Losimon knows in what way and under
which circumstances the phenomena of those days could be
brought about today, and, if requested by the magician, he will
initiate him into these methods. At the same time this head is able
to reveal to the magician the secrets of the phenomena of levitation,
so that these can either be brought about by the help of beings
or by the special powers or faculties which the magician has
acquired, because he has learned to control the electro-magnetic
fluid, and by the help of these fluids the magician is able to
regulate or overcome the gravitation of the earth. The magician
is, in that case, able to withdraw from the earth its power of
gravitation and by doing this he makes himself - and also other
people - as light as a feather so that, in consequence, he is able to
walk along the surface of waters without sinking or to lift his
body into the air. That he can practice this art with any object
whatsoever is quite clear.
<br><br>Fig. 122: Kiliki (8Â° Cancer) - initiates the magician into the
mysteries of rhythm and vibration, and, at the same time,
teaches him how both rhythm and vibration can be set at work in
any sphere or plane. Kiliki is regarded as the master of life, for life
is nothing else but rhythm and vibration.
<br><br>Fig. 123: Oramos (9Â° Cancer) - can give excellent information
on occult faculties, especially on clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairfeeling,
psychometry, and the like. He gives the magician special
instructions concerning the manufacture of magic mirrors, their
charging with certain influentual powers etc. and he teaches the
magician how to charge mirrors in the quabbalistic manner.
Even though the magician might be a perfect clairvoyant,
Oramos can teach him how to increase his acquired faculties.
This head also advises the magician on how he can procure
familiar spirits for certain purposes and how he is to treat these.
Oramos gives the magician also exact information on the so-called
"controlling spirits" for magic operations. If the magician has a
good connection with this intelligence, he may get from him
many other good and valuable hints.
<br><br>Fig. 124: Tarato (10Â° Cancer) - This head instructs the magician
how to influence the weather by the magic of water, by electrical
and magnetic fluids, by magic rituals, by the cosmic
language, and the like. He who has good contacts with this head
can let it rain or stop raining at his will, can lead lightning into a
certain direction, can cause a hail-storm and is, in general, able to
bring about and evoke anything that has to do with the weather.
<br><br>Fig. 125: Horomor (11Â° Cancer) - This head knows all high
magic mysteries - mysteries of initiation - of the zone girdling
the earth and also of our physical world, and can not only teach
the magician to understand them, but he is also able to arouse the
magician's intuition and inspiration by his radiation in such a
manner that he learns to control all mysteries of wisdom from
the universal point of view. One may call this head the instructor
in magical enlightenment.
<br><br>Fig. 126: Tmako (12Â° Cancer) - initiates the magician into all
secrets of transmutation of powers, effects, and the like, in the
zone girdling the earth and into the secrets of plants, minerals and
metals in our physical world. This intelligence, too, may be called
a guardian of true alchemy.
<br><br>Fig. 127: Nimalon (13Â° Cancer) - Any magician dealing with
invisible beings and intelligences and also acquainted with the
science of the Quabbalah will sometimes have made the experience
that it may be very difficult to reproduce intellectually
the language of the beings and the cosmic language. Nimalon can
assist the magician in this respect by making him acquainted with
the methods by which he may acquire the faculty of finding, at
any time, the right means to express and explain what might be
communicated in the cosmic language and the language of beings
and intelligences. Nimalon may therefore be regarded as a
marvelous initiator into the mode of expression in all intellectual
languages.
<br><br>Fig. 128: Camalo (14Â° Cancer) - This head is well informed on
the remotest secrets of magical science and shows the magician
means and ways, as well as methods, by which he can make
himself invisible. It is with Camalo's help that the magician
becomes invisible, i. e. that he can betake himself into all spheres,
mentally, astrally and, if necessary, also physically, without being
recognized there. The faculty of making oneself invisible
anywhere desired is quite a special faculty that is only controlled
by a few magicians.
<br><br>Fig. 129: Nimtrix (15Â° Cancer) - This high initiator into magic
teaches the magician the art of de-materializing any object by appropriate
methods, that is to de-condense it, and to materialize,
that is to condense it, again in the place where he wants to have it
appear. The magician may also employ beings for the dematerialization
and re-condensation which Nimtrix will place at
his disposal, should the magician want it.
<br><br>Fig. 130: Kalote (16Â° Cancer) - is a phenomenal expert and
master of cosmic laws. He is also an instructor in divine virtues
and therefore informs the magician about these, showing him
how these divine virtues, in their cause and effect, become valid
under the legality of the microcosm and macrocosm.
<br><br>Fig. 131: Ysquiron (17Â° Cancer) - makes the magician
recognize to what extent divine love, mercy and all parallel divine
virtues in respect of their legality, harmony and justice are applied,
and come into play in all the spheres and planes. From Ysquiron
the magician learns to differentiate these theurgic secrets.
A magician who is allied to this head knows not only about the
karmic effects in all spheres, but he also becomes acquainted - at
the same time - with very high quabbalistic secrets of the divine
emanation.
<br><br>Fig. 132: Sikesti (18Â° Cancer) - instructs the magician in respect

influences.

head the faculty of evoking, with his mental body, subordinate
beings in the zone girdling the earth, i. e. not in our physical
world, and to protect himself against diverse dangers, malice, and
the like. To carry out an evocation in the zone girdling the earth
with the mental body alone is far more difficult than in the
physical world, for there the magician has no supports for his
consciousness. What can be effected by such evocations will be explained
in detail to the magician by Kibigili.
<br><br>Fig. 135: Arakuson (21Â° Cancer) - instructs the magician cause,
purpose and effect of diverse laws and may, apart from this, lead

the zone girdling the earth, may be regarded as a high priest of
magic.
<br><br>Fig. 136: Maggio (22Â° Cancer) - The magician is instructed by
this head in how to put into action certain powers directly from

magic of space. The magician is taught by him how to become
master of time and space not only in our physical world and the
zone girdling the earth, but also in all other spheres of the

use of this faculty.
<br><br>Fig. 138: Akahimo (24Â° Cancer) - This head instructs the
magician on how to know and control the various degrees of
oscillation of the divine virtues, qualities and powers from the

also deals in practice with this high science.
<br><br>Fig. 139: Aragor (25Â° Cancer) - makes it possible for the magician
to look into the workshop of Divine Providence by using appropriate
methods and purification procedures and to recognize
and experience the correlative relations between the Akasha-principle
and the Divine Light, the first emanation of Divine Providence.

magician to he highest enlightenments of the zone girdling the
earth.
<br><br>Fig. 140: Granona (26Â° Cancer) - tells the magician about the
means necessary for achieving cosmic alliances within the interplanetary
spheres by diverse visions, no matter whether they
occur in trance, during sleep, or in day-dreams; or whether they

asstisted by Granona, may recognize, in the planetary spheres,
causes and effects reproduced either in true shape or by symbols.
<br><br>Fig. 141: Zagol (27Â° Cancer) - instructs the magician on the
magic of cosmic spheres. If the magician places himself in any
sphere with his mental body, for instance, into the zone girdling
the earth in which he possibly intends to practise ceremonial
magic, he can evoke, into this sphere, beings from other speres in
exactly the same way as if he were doing it in our physical sphere.
What laws, and the like, have to be adhered to in case of such
operations in certain spheres is a question on which Zagol will
give the magician exact information.
<br><br>Fig. 142: Mennolika (28Â° Cancer) - is a master of the quabbalah,
i. e. a master of divine theurgy. This head teaches the magician
how to use divine names, in a quabbalistic manner, for
various spheres. Apart from this, the magician is informed, by
Mennolika, about the various virtues of Divine Emanation, its
cause and effect in each planetary sphere, from the quabbalistic
point of view.
<br><br>Fig. 143: Forfasan (29Â° Cancer) - draws the magician's attention
to the various systems of wisdom. He reveals to the magician his
own individual way in which he will travel once he has reached a
certain degree of maturity. In the zone girdling the earth this head
is regarded as a protector of wisdom and the keys to it.
<br><br>Fig. 144: Charonthona (30Â° Cancer) - imparts to the magician
diverse practices with the Akasha-principle. On the basis of
special methods Charonthona demonstrates to the magician how
diverse magical operations have their direct cause in the Akashaprinciple,
and therefore produce effects. Charonthona is an excellent
connoisseur of the laws of cause and effect, i. e. an expert
on Karma.

tells the magician how to control passions by certain magical aids
and other means and how they can be transmuted into opposite,
positive qualities. The practices recommended by this head may

the way to magic development, and who have certain passions
they are not able to control.
<br><br>Fig. 148: Mahra (4Â° Leo) - instructs the magician in the magic

of the air principle from the magical point of view. He is an excellent
initiator into the art of breathing, the pranayama, and
teaches the magician how to apply this art correctly. By

of air, but the accumulation of power.
<br><br>Fig. 153: Anemalon (9Â° Leo) - is a good initiator into all

disharmonies can be fully explained to the magician by this intelligence.

for arousing inside him his talents for prophecy. If the
magician wishes it, Rimog by himself or by one of his subordinates,

refer to our physical world.
<br><br>Fig. 166: Abbetira (22Â° Leo) - shows the magician the way to acquire

<br>*
<br>The seals of the thirty heads who belong to the zodiacal sign of
Virgo are all to be drawn in brown colour.
<br><br>Fig. 175: Peresch (1Â° Virgo) - controls all political events in our
physical world. Depending on the degree of development and
maturity of mankind he causes this or that idea to come to importance
and social attitudes to become valuable. Furthermore, he
decides on the duration of a political power, either by appropriate
diplomatic developments or by wars, and he lets political views
have failure or success, as Divine Providence orders it, considering
the spiritual development of mankind. If the magician
wants it, then this head helps him with a high political career,
equips him with the faculties of an excellent orator, who knows
how to bind people by word. Apart from this, he equips the
magician with toughness and endurance which remain without
comparison so that he can realize all his wishes in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 176: Bruahi (2Â° Virgo) - is the protector of all inventions in
the Akasha-principle, so that they are not realized before their
time. As occasion demands, he inspires certain individuals to
make certain inventions and causes these to be realized in the
physical world. However, this head also hinders people with high
intuitive faculties from realizing inventions which are not to be
made known to the public before a longer time, maybe a century
or five centuries, has passed. The magician in the favour of this
head is shown by him under the seal of secrecy, in the Akashaprinciple,
which kind of inventions will startle our world in a
hundred or even a thousand years.
<br><br>Fig. 177: Moschel (3Â° Virgo) - controls every art on our physical
world. His subordinates administrate the various branches of art.
Special methods revealed to the magician by this head, either by
his relevant subordinated beings or direct transference, enable the
magician to equip himself with any artistic faculy. Moschel also
helps the magician to make an artistic career.
<br><br>Fig. 178: Raschea (4Â° Virgo) - One could justly regard this head
as the king of flowers, for all the flowers on our earth are under
his protection. From this head the magician learns to understand
the language of flowers, i. e. the symbolic meaning of the various
kinds of flowers in their realionship to man as well as to the
universal laws. The colour, shape and number of the petals reveal
to the magician the analogies to the universal laws and he sees
from this what, in the world of flowers, is real beauty.
Penetrating deeper into this knowledge, the magician learns to
look at and understand each flower from the esoteric point of
view, and he learns to grasp the qualities of each flower in any
respect and to use them for magic purposes.
<br><br>Fig. 179: Girmil (5Â° Virgo) - This head is a representative of
love, harmony and beauty, and at the same time their protector.
He teaches the magician to see love in everything. Love and harmony
on the one hand, and hate and disharmony on the other
will teach the magician to understand, too, the exact laws of sympathy
and antipathy. Not before having gained this knowledge
will the magician realize what is true beauty and that, in fact,
beauty is but another expression for harmony. This head helps
the magician to come to a genuine perception of beauty.
<br><br>Fig. 180: Zagriona (6Â° Virgo) - All teaching in its widest sense
comes under this head's sphere of influence. All teachers, writers,
journalists and editors are protected by this intelligence. If the
magician needs any advice in this or in a similar respect, if he
needs protection, or if he desires to be successful, Zagriona will
either assist him personally or send one of his beings to give help.
<br><br>Fig. 181: Ygilon (7Â° Virgo) - is regarded as the original initiator
into speech and writing. Having received orders from Divine Providence,
he has caused man, since his creation, to express
thoughts, terms, ideas etc. first by signs, then by articulated
sounds and words, later by compound sentences and finally as a
language. Then the head instructed his subordinates to see that
this language was expressed externally in form of symbols in
diverse ways, thereby laying the initial brick for literature as a
means of communication and written tradition. But it took a long
time until the language in writing reached the present state of
literature. This head will make it easy for the magician dealing
with the decoding of ancient, so far unrevealed, letters, and interpreting
them. There are no records in writing on earth that could
not be decoded by the magician with the help of this inttelligence
or his subordinates. Ygilon can also instruct the magician in the
so-called magic of runes.
<br><br>Fig. 182: Alpaso (8Â° Virgo) - Since the beginning of human
records this head has been the protector of all poor and supressed.
In the Akasha he controls the fates of all slaves, beggars, gipsies,
homeless persons, etc. He also helps persons who, by having
become addicts to narcotics, are thrown out of the normal way of
life, especially in cases where these people should, according to
their fate, not be met by any accidents. Such people then pass
every inconvenience without difficulties. Here the saying may be
applied that "drunkards have a charmed life".
<br><br>Fig. 183: Kirek (9Â° Virgo) - is known as an excellent initiator
into alchemical magic. He shows the magician many methods by
which he can strengthen the bond between the astral body and
the spirit and also such methods by which he can make his astral
body immune from destruction by astral elements and so reach
astral immortality. If the magician asks for it, this head will instruct
him in such methods by which he can cause the same effects
in respect of the astral matrix, thus for his physical body, so
that he is able to prolong his life as long as he wans. If the magician
applies the methods given by this intelligence, age will show
no effects on his body, he will never suffer from any exernal influence.
Wounds caused by stabs or cuts, even the strongest heat,
cannot do any harm to the body sheltered in such a way.
<br><br>Fig. 184: Buriuh (10Â° Virgo) - is an excellent initiator into
alchemical secrets and entrusts the magician with methods by
which he can achieve diverse faculties and powers by the application
of appropriate alchemical means. This intelligence reveals to
the magician how to produce diverse alchemicallove medicines,
incense, magic ointments, oils for exteriorisation and other
mediumistic purposes. Apart from this, Buriuh helps with the
charging and impregnation of alchemical means, either personally
or by his subordinates.
<br><br>Fig. 185: Yraganon (11Â° Virgo) - If the magician wants to have
esteem, success, honour and riches in business, this head can help
him a great deal in this respect by putting at his disposal his
subordinates. Apart from this, he can make the magician achieve
great skill in his trade or profession. All trade men having to deal
with metals, expecially iron are under the special protection of
this head, thus, for instance, technicians, constructors, engineers,
smiths, mechanics, etc. If the magician carries out any such jobs,
he can achieve great things with the help of this head of the zone
girdling the earth.
<br><br>Fig. 186: Argaro (12Â° Virgo) - is the custodian of all relics, holy
places, temples, churches, statues of saints, pictures of saints, etc.
and, furthermore, of all religions of the world from the beginning
of mankind up to modern ages. A magician in contact with
this head will be informed by him how divine ideas, deities, etc.
are symbolised by pictures of saints, statues, temples and other
symbols. He also tells the magician how in turn pictures, statues,
monuments are, as personified deities, true analogies of the
divine ideas, concepts, etc. Argaro also explains to the magician
the rites with personified deities and reveals to him their secret
meanmg.
<br><br>Fig. 187: Algebol (13Â° Virgo) - is the expert and leader of all
traditional religious rites, rituals and ceremonies of all religious
systems. He may justly be regarded as a master of ceremonies. He
acquaints the magician with all ceremonies, rituals and customs of
any religion or sect, historical or modern, and explains to him
their significance, thus enabling the magician to realize the full
magical value, the power or dynamics of a ritual or ceremony.
<br><br>Fig. 188: Karasa (14Â° Virgo) - is the protector of all medical
doctors in the world. Even the medicine -men of the days of yore
looked up to this head of the zone girdling the earth with devotion
and made him sacrifices. But even nowadays doctors,
especially surgeons, are inspired by this intelligence. Karasa arranges
that certain sick people are cured by certain physicians. The
whole chemical-pharmaceutical production comes under the
range of his powers. The sick magician who seeks the help of this
head will get from him the exact diagnosis and will be told ways
and remedies by which he can recover his physical health.
<br><br>Fig. 189: Akirgi (15Â° Virgo) - The magician may summon this
head in all business matters, for he will always secure him the biggest
success. Akirgi has a special affection for everything that has
to do with paper or textiles. His influence, however, also covers
the working up of furs, skins, leather, and the like, so that the
magician will be supported by this intelligence not only in
business affairs, but will also be able to get from him special
recipes for the working up of furs, leather, etc. The magician may
also be taught about many methods for the working up of paper and
about impregnation materials which so far have not yet been
made known to the public.
<br><br>Fig. 190: Basanola (16Â° Virgo) - Since this head controls all
vegetation, he may be regarded as the protector of agriculture and
forestry. He is an expert in this respect, and the magician who
gets into touch with him may learn a great deal from him. Apart
from giving methods and instructions for effecting a good growth
of plants, this head also instructs the magician in special magicquabbalistic
methods by which growth of plants can be accelerated
or delayed, depending on what the magician wishes.
<br><br>Fig. 191: Rotor (17Â° Virgo) - is a master of fantastic vision.
Under his competence come all sagas, fairy-tales and stories. This
head inspires all thoses poets and writers who are occupied with
the production of sagas, fairy-tales and stories. Rotor provides
them with an excellent power of imagination and lets them express
this in suitable words. He likes to hide true events and
magic secrets by fairy-tales, so that the magician, having called
him, is given the appropriate explanations as to what each fairytale
contains from the hermetic point of view.
<br><br>Fig. 192: Tigrapho (18Â° Virgo) - is a master of architecture and
the art of structural engineering. From the beginning of mankind he
has instructed man how he should dwell. Tigrapho is regarded the
protector of all builders and architects on earth and assists them by
inspirations in their design-work, no matter whether they are designing
highways, river basins, water works or anything of that sort. If
the magician is in this profession, Tigrapho may help him a great
deal by intuition.
<br><br>Fig. 193: Cobel (19Â° Virgo) - is able to initiate the magician into
the art of magic scents. From this head the magician learns to
compose harmonious and inharmonious scents, for instance,
scents that cause love and sympathy or optional dreams, or scents
which can increase one's power of concentration; scents for
meditations, incense materials for diverse magic experiments, etc.
The magician may also be told by Cobel details concerning
osmotherapy, i. e. the treatment of diseases by scents.
<br><br>Fig. 194: Hipogo (20Â° Virgo) - Everything that has to do with
water and its relation to man falls under the competence of this
head; thus, for instance, swimming, diving, moving along the surface
of waters in all kinds of vessels, beginning from the simplest
raft up to the most up to date steamship. Hipogo is the inspirer of
ship-building, including the construction of submarines and
everything that moves on or in the water and is build by men. If
the magician is interested, this head will allow him to look into
the most distant future to see all technical inventions to come in
respect of mankind moving along the water.
<br><br>Fig. 195: Iserag (210 Virgo) - is regarded as the conveyor of fortune
to mankind. He brings luck in games, competitions, at the
stockexchange, in speculations and ventures of any kind. The
magician who has this head as his friend will have every wish
fulfilled in the physical world, he will be fortunate and successful
in everything he undertakes. This head will also entrust him
with methods which will give him happiness and contentment in
any respect.
<br><br>Fig. 196: Breffeo (22Â° Virgo) - can be regarded as custodian of
material laws and of justice. In every case where the magician is in
the right this head will see that the matter is decided in the magician's
favour. Breffeo punishes, either personally or by one of his
subordinates, any person that will do the magician injustice or
who intends to do so, without the magician necessarily knowing
about it. People who persecute the magician will be maliciously
punished by Breffeo's subordinate spirits, especially if the magician
has had, or still has, good connections to this head.
<br><br>Fig. 197: Elipinon (23Â° Virgo) - By this head the magician is instructed
and trained in all mantic arts according to the laws of
analogy, no matter whether fortune-telling with cards, the tarot
game, I-Ging, chiromancy, horoscopy, or anything of that sort is
involved. Elipinon makes it possible for the magician to become a
prophet by the training of the mantic arts and he helps him in
becoming a genuine expert in this respect. Mantic experts all over
the world are under the control of this head of the zone girdling
the earth.
<br><br>Fig. 198: Naniroa (24Â° Virgo) - guards the property of every
person. The magician who has this head as his special friend has
his property protected by his subordinates against all kinds of
catastrophe, not only fire, thunderstorms, floods, but also against
burglary, theft, etc. Naniroa will make him acquainted with
methods by which a thief can be forced to return the stolen articles,
or influenced in such a manner that he will betray himself.
Also other magic practices for the recovery of lost goods can be
learned from this head.
<br><br>Fig. 199: Olaski (25Â° Virgo) - is the original initiator of all
vehicles and means for transportation on the dry ground, starting
from the simple cart up to the most modern automobile. If the
magician wants to get certain information on this field, or if he
wants to make technical improvements and new inventions, he
will find his best master and assistant in this head. If he has a good
contact with this intelligence, he can be sure to be especially well
protected in his vehicle on dry land. During former connections
with this head I was able to look into the far future in the Akashaprinciple
to see vehicles no longer driven by combustion engines
or atomic power. Quite a different kind of fuel will be used for
the vehicles of transportation in the far future and will move
them along at an incredible speed without any noise or odour.
However, I was forbidden to reveal any details about this. The
future alone will prove it true and that every new invention has
long before been laid down in the Akasha-principle.
<br><br>Fig. 200: Hyrmiua (26Â° Virgo) - is a mighty protector of
human consciousness on our earth. The average man would hardly
be able to comprehend the range of power of this head. He
prevents, for instance, the consciousness of the average man from
travelling beyond the limits of the physical world. However, he
allows the magician to enlarge the capacity of his consciousness,
depending on his magical maturity. In other words: this head controls
the development and maturity of each human being. He
decides whether a person suffering from disturbances of his consciousness,
an insane man or woman, should become healthy
again and regain his normal state of mind. If this intelligence approves
of his recovery, the psychiatrist will succeed in making the
person completely sane again. Hyrmiua also controls all those
people committing suicide, whose deed is not carried out under
the conditions of Karma, so that they do not regain there consciousness
in the astral world before the period has elapsed which
they should have lived on earth. Not before the expiration of this
certain period will suicides awake from their twilight sleep to get
their full astral consciousness. Much more could be said about
this head; but, however, these hints will be enough for the magician;
if he gets into contact with this intelligence, he will never go
astray mentally and will be given, by this intelligence, the power
to read the consciousness of every man and to influence it. For instance,
he could make him memorize pictures of the past or else
delete such pictures completely from his memory. The magician
learns from this head how to carry out a transference of consciousness
in the magical manner, which, in the orient, is known
under the name of "Abisheka" or "Ankhur".
<br><br>Fig. 201: Sumuram (27Â° Virgo) - is the master of all animals of
the air. From the smallest fly up to the noble eagle all come under
his protection. To the magician in contact with this head will be
revealed all the secrets of flying animals. If the magician wishes it,
Sumuram will show him methods and give him instructions by
which he can gain the power of controlling every animal of the
air. By using appropriate words the magician, for instance, succeeds
in forcing the greediest eagle or vulture to come down from
great heights and to sit down without anxiety on the shoulders of
the magician. He can tame any bird of prey in a manner that it
will play with children and not harm the tiniest animal. Many
other magic arts in respect of the animal kingdom, which to the
average man must sound incredible, can be carried out by the
magician.
<br><br>Fig. 202: Astolitu (28Â° Virgo) - is a special custodian of many
magic keys and secrets. In our present state of development he
leads and controls the aeronautics of the whole world with all its
inventions. He can give the magician many inspirations in this
respect. To the magician of the highest rank he reveals the secrets
of gravitation and instructs him in the practical application of the
power of gravity. Long before our civilization - many thousand
years ago - our earth was inhabited by people with a high
civilization who were far advanced in comparison to us in the
techniques of aviation. To them gravity was no problem. They
moved without motors or using gas to the highest altitudes
reaching speeds equivalent to the rotational speed of our earth,
transported without any effort and without mechanical help the
heaviest loads from one place to another. After their ruin, which
they had themselves brought about, Astolitu, the head of the
zone girdling the earth took the keys back to himself again and
now keeps them safely up to that day when mankind will have
reached the necessary maturity and degree of development. In the
Akasha-principle, there has never been anything lost, for
everything remains registered there. Only the highest magicians
can read everything in the Akasha-principle, which necessarily
must remain a secret to the normal world.
<br><br>Fig. 203: Notiser (29Â° Virgo) - Intellect and knowledge of every
human being in the physical world are under the protection of
this head of the zone girdling the earth. Depending on the state of
maturity of a person, he controls his capacity of perception and
makes him know things that are appropriate to his momentary
degree of development. This head can therefore be justly regarded
as master of knowledge, for it is by his influence that a man's intellect
on this earth is sharpened, his memory is enlarged, no matter
with which field of science the person is dealing. The magician
is given instructions by this head which, if he follows them,
enable him to increase the capacity of his intellect and to
strengthen his memory. Notiser informs the magician about any
field of science and he provides all fields of science with that
amount of knowledge that can be comprehended by man in their
present state of development.
<br><br>Fig. 204: Regerio (30Â° Virgo) - The last head of the zone girdling
the earth under the zodiacal sign of Virgo, Regerio, is the
custodian of many mysteries of wisdom and sees that true
wisdom is only made accessible to virtually mature people. If,
however, it should happen that magic secrets become known to
the inmature and unauthorized, this custodian of the mysteries of
wisdom blocks the way to wisdom for these unauthorized persons
by shrouding them in darkness with unbelief, suspicion, selfconceit
and one-sided views, leaving the true mysteries covered
and occult to him even though they may be stored in thousand
drawers of the immature. The magician who succeeds in getting
into contact with Regerio is taught by him to realize the difference
between knowledge and wisdom by intuition.
<br>*
<br>The following thirty heads of the zone girdling the earth come
under the zodiacal sign of Libra. Their seals, for the first evocation,
have to be drawn in green.
<br><br>Fig. 205: Thirana (1Â° Libra) - This head controls the sexual
sphere of man. The propagation of mankind falls therefore under
his competence. Thirana can give many instructions and methods
how the magician is to impregnate magically his own seed with
various qualities before having sexual intercourse, so that these
qualities pass over into the generated child. The magician is provided
with full knowledge, by this head, in respect of the prenatal
education of a child, i. e. the embodying of certain faculties,
hereditary factors, etc., in a magical manner, during the babies sojourn
in the womb.
<br><br>Fig. 206: Apollyon (2Â° Libra) - This head has inspired mankind
since its creation in respect of the working-up of metals, depending
on their state of development. Apollyon is regarded as the
original initiator of all those people who have been occupied with
the working up of metals, no matter whether founder, smith,
engineer, mechanic, or the like. Apollyon not only is the original
initiator into all the ideas in this field, but he also is their loyal
custodian.
<br><br>Fig. 207: Peekah (3Â° Libra) - This head already taught the
primitive peoples of the days of yore by inspiration that animal
meat eaten in a raw state is not so delicious as roasted or cooked.
He inspired a few individuals how to tell the difference between
the various kinds of meat by tasting them and taught them by
intuition to prepare many meat dishes. For the preparation of
such meat dishes man started rearing domestic animals, so that
during the course of time stock-farming was developed, whereby
Peekah has always been, and still is, a good inspirer of mankind
also in this respect. Smoked and tinned meat also come under the
competence of this head. If requested by the magician, this intelligence
will initiate him into the art of cooking and will acquaint
him with many recipes for the preparation of meat dishes
which so far have never been known.
<br><br>Fig. 208: Nogah (4Â° Libra) - The fertility and the power of propagation
of men and women come under the power of this head.
He controls by his vibrations the sexual sphere of both man and
woman and decides on the ability for life in the seed. The magician
may be informed by Nogah how to maintain his sexual
faculties up to great age and, furthermore, how sterility and impotence
in respect of woman and man can be treated successfully.
The magician can get a wealth of additional information on this
field from this head.
<br><br>Fig. 209: Tolet (5Â° Libra) - This head controls the feeding
habits of man and shows him which kind of food is necessary for
the maintenance of his health and what is harmful. Tolet is also
the initiator into all recipes for diets. By this intelligence the
magician is taught the difference between the electric, the
magnetic and the electromagnetic fluids in their relation to the
various dishes and how to take them into consideration in the
case of illness. This head also draws the magician's attention to
the diverse kinds of food which serve as stimulants for the production
of special states of mind.
<br><br>Fig. 210: Parmasa (6Â° Libra) - is a master of gaity and lets man
laugh and enjoy himself from his very core. Under his competence
fall amusing ideas, jokes, jests, anecdotes, comedies, and
other sorts of entertainment. He or his subordinates inspire man
to tell funny jokes and such like stories, or to write and perform
them. The magician may get the most amusing ideas from this
head or his subordinates to enable him to entertain whole parties,
and the like. If the magician is in contact with this head, he will
himself become convinced that Parmasa always shows himself
full of gaity.
<br><br>Fig. 211: Gesegos (7Â° Libra) - Wood and everything connected'
with it falls under the competence of this head. He is the guardian
angel of all those people who are occupied with wood and its
working, for instance, lumber-jacks, carpenters, joiners, cabinet
makers, turners, carvers, patternmakers, etc. If the magician is interested
in any of these fields, he can learn much from this head
that has not been known up to this date; for instance, the impregnation
of wood against all influences from elements, means
which give wood, even the softest kind of wood, great resistance
and duration, so that it can only be compared with steel. This
head can make known to the magician many other interesting
new ideas.
<br><br>Fig. 212: Soteri (8Â° Libra) - is the original initiator into all
musical instruments that man has ever used, the most modern
ones of the present age included. Soteri inspires all composers. He
teaches the magician who has musical talent or is interested in
music to adapt each musical piece to the relevant element and, vice
versa, to express harmonically, i. e. according to the universal laws,
what he wants to express by music. This head may justly be called
the musician of the zone girdling the earth.
<br><br>Fig. 213: Batamabub (9Â° Libra) - The clothes and headgear of
man have been under the power of this head right from the prime
origin up to the present day. He controls the clothes and headgear
of man and influences them according to climate, weather,
maturity, personal attitude, and so on. Batamabub is the inspirer
of each momentary fashion, so that rank, social position,
religions, etc., are also taken into consideration. Furthermore, he
suggests to man out of which material his clothes and headgear are
to be made. Therefore all fashion designers and fashion creators,
tailors, dressmakers, milliners, etc. are protected by him. If the
magician is interested, he can have all fashions of all peoples,
beginning from the prime origin to the present day, presented to
him by this head in the Akasha-principle. He can even view the
fashions of the days to come.
<br><br>Fig. 214: Omana (10Â° Libra) - The hairy covering of the
human body forms a part of the competence of this head. He is
the inspirer of all coiffures and kinds of beards. Hairdressers and
barbers of both sexes are constantly under his influence. All inventions
refering to the growing of beards and hair, starting from
the simple comb up to the most modern apparatus, from razor
blade to the electric razor, are controlled by this head. The magician
who gets into touch with this intelligence may learn which
substances will make hair grow and which will remove unwanted
hairs, etc. Omana can also make the magician acquainted with
diverse substances for hair dyeing. Having personally evoked this
head, I was shown, in the Akasha-principle, the hair colour of the
future. Chemical substances will no longer be necessary, for these
usually do harm to the roots of the hairs; the hair of man will be
dyed by radiation apparatus without any evil effects on the hair
and the hair-bed. However, I have been forbidden to say more
about this. Nevertheless, the future will bring the proof of the
prediction.
<br><br>Fig. 215: Lagiros (11Â° Libra) - Directly by himself or indirectly
by the influence of his subordinates this head helps the magician
to gain the favour of very important people, to have petitions
handed in to them approved, etc. This head can cause a very important
person to take a benevolent attitude towards the magician;
he can create favourable situations, and the like.
<br><br>Fig. 216: Afrei (12Â° Libra) - This head is an initiator and master
of the high magic of love. He teaches the magician how to produce
many wonders in the mental, astral and physical world by
the dynamization of divine qualities, especially of divine love and
mercy.
<br><br>Fig. 217: Rigolon (13Â° Libra) - is the initiator into all kinds of
wooing, starting from the origin of mankind. He himself or his
subordinates inspire man with all possible kinds of wooing. If the
magician wants to learn the art of wooing, if he wants to be
regarded as an amiable person everywhere and if, furthermore, he
intends to get into good company, this head can help him. He advises
the magician on how to gain the affection of a certain person,
how to get into his favour, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 218: Riqita (14Â° Libra) - is a master of singing. If the
magician wishes it, he will equip him with a lovely voice which
will fascinate people. Therefore this head may justly be called the
protector of all male and female singers, so matter whether singing
is their profession or their special hobby when in company.
Requita shows the ways and means how to cultivate one's voice.
<br><br>Fig. 219: Tapum (15Â° Libra) - This head is an excellent artist
and is appointed to awake in the magician a sense for arts. He is
the original initiator into everything that has to do with
embellishment and ornamentation - the docorations used for
festivities, shopwindows, etc. He is, at the same time, the origianl
initiator of all kinds of advertising. If the magician is in need of
his assistance, this head will be prepared to help him at any time.
<br><br>Fig. 220: Nachero (16Â° Libra) - controls the health and duration
of life of all animals on earth. He is also the controlling spirit for
all instincts. Therefore he inspires man with all the curing
methods and remedies against the various diseases of animals.
Under his control are all zoologists, veterinary surgeons and
tamers of wild animals. Nachero inspires the magician with a
great variety of healing methods and medicines for diseased
animals. He can also communicate many magic practices to be applied
on animals, for instance, such by which milking animals are
caused to give much milk, or such practices by which they can be
protected against unfavourable influences, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 221: Arator (17Â° Libra) - This head is the initiator of all intoxicating
drinks. From the prime origin he has been teaching
man by intuition how to make the most diverse kinds of intoxicating
drinks, for instance, wine, mead, beer, liquor, etc. which
are to put man into a happy mood and make him bear his lot
more easily. However, this head must not be mistaken for the
contra-genius of this sphere who controls the notorious
drunkards. All those people are protected by Arator who have to
do with the production and selling of alcoholic drinks. The magician
may get from this head excellent recipes for the production
of wine, beer and liquor, and, on top of this, certain advice on
how these beverages can be ameliorated by various methods. He
also reveals to the magician magic recipes and instructions on
how, for instance, he can, under the influence of the amalgamation
of elements, change water into wine; furthermore, how he
can protect himself successfully against the influence of the
alcohol contained in these beverages, so that even great quantities
of alcohol wi11leave him sober.
<br><br>Fig. 222: Malata (18Â° Libra) - explains to the magician the
secrets of human and animal blood. He not only tells him about
its classification in groups and RH-factors - which is already
known to the medical science of today - but many more things
in the fields of science like medicine, chemistry, physiology,
psychology, laws of heredity, etc. Apart from this, Malata initiates
the magician into the secrets of the blood from the magic
and alchemical points of view, which, if put down on paper,
would fill many volumes.
<br><br>Fig. 223: Arioth (19Â° Libra) - is the guardian angel of all women
on earth delivering babies. Having always taken into consideration
the states of development and maturity, this head has inspired
man with the various methods of midwifery, starting from
the most primitive deliveries up to the most modern methods of
gynaecology. He therefore is the protector of all gynaecologists,
midwives, etc. Arioth draws the magician's attention to the
diverse magic and sympathetic methods for a painless delivery.
<br><br>Fig. 224: Agikus (20Â° Libra) - Man still faces many great problems
and mysteries in electro-chemistry, and they will not be
revealed to him until the far off future. However, this head can
unveil to the magician many secrets in this respect and entrust
him with the relevant knowledge. Agikus is the original initiator
into galvanic electricity. Following his intuitive inspirations, men
have invented batteries, accumulators, the dissolving of metals by
electricity, catalysts, etc. Electro-homoeopathy, too, comes under
the competence of this head. He allowed me to look into the
future, and I saw tiny quantities of chemical compounds changing
into great electrical discharges with an immense voltage and
amperage, the knowledge of which will be of great value to men
in the technical and domestic domain. To give details about this
here, would sound incredible and too much like a fairy story,
and, in order not to sound ridiculous, I desist from giving any
details. When mankind is more mature and more developed a few
eminent individuals will be inspired by this head with new inventions
and discoveries.
<br><br>Fig. 225: Cheikaseph (21Â° Libra) - is regarded as the original initiator
into mathematics on the earth. The range of competence
of this head varies from the easiest adding operations to the most
difficult mathematical problems expressed by astronomical
figures, including the basic ideas of the mathematical figure, of
measurements and weights in relation to matter. From this head
the magician may learn, for instance, how to express an idea in
mathematical figures and he may, on the other side, be informed
how to accumulate intellectually the knowledge of quantities and
qualities. The magician is also initiated by Cheikaseph into the socalled
quabbalistic quadruple key, which brings the four fundamental
mathematical operations, i. e. adding, subtracting,
multiplying and dividing, into relation to quabbalistic science, to
the elements of the micro- and macrocosm. Cheikaseph is a very
powerful head, and the magician may learn from him more than
enough.
<br><br>Fig. 226: Ornion (22Â° Libra) - is the initiator into physiology.
He does not only teach the magician the usual facts about
physiology, but also lets him look at this field of science from the
hermetic point of view. Ornion makes the magician acquainted
with all the necessary scientific facts by which the latter can tell
the character and personal peculiarities of an individual already
by his appearance. For the reader's information I mention here a
number of faculties which this head can awake in the magician:
the art of reading from a person's face (physionomy), the art of
reading from a person's forehead, the art of chiromancy, of
diagnosing from fingers and fingernails, from the eyes, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 227: Gariniranus (23Â° Libra) - is the initiator into physics.
Everything that has been explored in this field up to the present
day has happened on account of the intuitive inspiration by this
head. The magician may not only learn from this intelligence
about the achievements of physics in the far future, but he may
also be initiated into all phases of metaphysics and receive instructions
on how to make practical use of this. This head can also
initiate the magician into astrophysics.
<br><br>Fig. 228: Istaroth (24Â° Libra) - is a protector of loyalty. He
keeps together man and woman in fidelity. If the magician wishes
it, he can, with the assistance of this head or his subordinates, influence
any person, man or woman, so that they will never be
disloyal. He can also, by the help of this head, discover any cause
of infidelity or hinder it before it starts. Istaroth can change the
magician's worst enemy into his best friend and secure him the
love, friendship and sympathy of any person.
<br><br>Fig. 229: Haiamon (25Â° Libra) - instructs the magician in the
transmutation of the sexual power of man and entrusts him with
various relevant practices that so far have remained quite
unknown. Haiamon knows about the most secret mysteries in
this line. The magician may learn very much from this head, such
as, for instance, how to increase or decrease sexual power, how
this can be transmuted for various magical practices into the
original elemental substance, etc. He can also give information on
new, so far unknown compounds of hormones, and of many
other things.
<br><br>Fig. 230: Canali (26Â° Libra) - has been, from the days of yore,
the initiator into jewellery of any kind. He controls, by his subordinates,
all novelties in the fashion of jewellery, for instance,
rings, bracelets, precious stones, in short, any kind of jewellery
that is for wearing. All the people are protected by this head who
are involved in the manufacture of jewels, i. e. gold-miners, goldsmiths,
jewellers, etc. The magician may also learn many interesting
things from Canali in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 231: Aglasis (27Â° Libra) - Everything connected with milk
in respect of man and animal comes under the competence of this
head, who is justly regarded as the guardian of babies and mam-
mals. Aglasis has, during the course of time, taught mankind to
milk animals and not only to use the milk as a beverage, but also
for the making of other products. Thus man has learned to produce
from milk butter, cottage cheese, and so on. The working up
of milk is still very far from having reached its climax, and the
magician may be introduced into many novelties in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 232: Merki (28Â° Libra) - All animals living in the water and
their propagation are under the competence of this head. Merki is
the protector of all fishermen on earth. He is responsible for good
and bad luck in fishing. He has taught mankind to tin fish. This
industry, too, is far from having reached its summit, and there are
still many discoveries to be made which will astonish man. The
magician is taught by this head how to control the water animals
by the magic of elements and by Quabbalah, how they, for instance,
can be caused to congregate at certain places, etc. He may,
furthermore, hear about many other practices concerning the
controlling of water animals.
<br><br>Fig. 233: Filakon (29Â° Libra) - This head has inspired mankind
with the sense of orderliness and cleaness. During the evolution
of man everything connected with the hygiene of the health and
the sick has come under the control of this head. Under his
special care are all those people who have to deal with hygiene in
medicine. Filakon is also the originator of the fact that many
diseases are caused by infection, he renders the means to man to
recognize these and protect himself against them. Filakon is the
protector and initiator of all bacteriologists, toxicologists and
other people who deal with the research of diseases caused by
bacteria, bacilli, virus, etc. This head draws the magician's attention
to diseases which at the moment are regarded as the scourge
of mankind, and which are being caused by infection. He does
not only make the magician acquainted with the true cause of a
disease, but he also tells him confidently how any disease can be
coped with successfully. If the magician wishes it, he will tell him
about diseases which up to this date have remained unknown and
about the way in which they can be cured.
<br><br>Fig. 234: Megalogi (30Â° Libra) - is somehow connected with the
head dealt with before: he guards all the medicinal springs on
earth. He even causes animals to step into certain waters instinctively
in case of injuries. With Megalogi's assistance man has
learned from the animals how they cure themselves of certain
diseases, and he has used these observations to his own advantage.
Thus the various treatments by medicinal waters were introduced
and many places with mineral springs have been changed into
health resorts for the welfare of man. Megalogi does not only lead
the magician's attention towards mineral springs which up to
now have not yet been discovered, but he also initiates him into
the complete field of hydrotherapy, and entrusts him with practices
which are still completely unknown to science.
<br>*
<br>The next thirty heads of the zone girdling the earth are under
the zodiacal sign of Scorpio and their seals have to be drawn in
red colour.
<br><br>Fig. 235: Aluph (1Â° Scorpio) - This head is a protector of fire on
our earth. Everything connected with fire is completely revealed
to the magician by this head: everything from the point of view
of magic, electrical fluid, beings of the fire-element, salamanders,
as well as all inventions connected with the practical use of fire in
the physical world.
<br><br>Fig. 236: Schaluah (2Â° Scorpio) - is regarded as the original
initiator into electricity. He has made man acquainted with electricity
and has, during the course of time, caused certain individuals
to make all kinds of inventions in this line. Since all the
possibilities in electricity are still very far from having been exhausted,
the future world will be delighted by many a new invention.
A magician who has got into contact with this head, can
already obtain details of all this, especially in respect of the relevant
facts of magical science. The electric fluid, for example, will
playa great role in every plane in the future, for it will be applied
in most diverse ways.
<br><br>Fig. 237: Hasperim (3Â° Scorpio) - This head has inspired man
and animal with the drive for self-preservation. He has rendered
the animals appropriate means for protection by nature to defend
themselves against dangers. He is the inspirer of animal instincts.
Man has been caused by him to make a living by hard work, endurance
and diligence. Therefore everything that induces man to
go ahead comes under this head's competence. A magician allied
with this head will be equipped with enormous powers, either by
the head himself or by his subordinates, and he will even be able
to transfer these powers on to other people which will help to
reach any aim at any time. Hasperim knows about many secrets
concerning human intellect and would be quite willing to reveal
them to the magician, depending on his maturity and development.
<br><br>Fig. 238: Adae (4Â° Scorpio) - is the protector of child love,
motherly love and parental love, and of everything that keeps a
family together. Assisted by this head, the magician is able to deal
with any quarrel or discord in the family. Adae is quite prepared
to teach the magician how to eliminate any quarrel by acquiring
diverse practices.
<br><br>Fig. 239: Helmis (5Â° Scorpio) - Everything connected with milk
on this earth, in respect of man as well as animal, falls under the
competence of this head. He protects all nurses and all mothers
who suckle their babies. All mammals on earth are protected by
this head. The range of his competence is very wide. During the
course of time he has taught man to use milk as nutrition. Inspired
by this head, man has learned to use the milk gained from
animals not only as a drink, but also for the manufacture of dairy
products. Helmis has inspired man to introduce a milk diet for
certain kinds of diseases and to produce from milk various types
of medicine. Many things connected with the working up of
milk, which will not become known to the public until the distant
future may now be revealed to the magician by this head.
<br><br>Fig. 240: Sarasi (6Â° Scorpio) - is the original initiator of all
human ideals, no matter whether ideals of the physical, astral or
mental world are concerned. Depending on the maturity and
development of mankind, this head controls, by his subordinates,
the most diverse ideals of each individual and causes situations
and possibilities for the realization of an ideal in the mental, astral
or physical world to a small or large extent. Sarasi supplies man
with the appropriate enthusiasm and the endurance for the
realization of the ideal in question in accordance with one's
maturity and fate. This head, too, may teach the magician a great
deal: for instance, how various ideals are born in our world and
how they decay again; furthermore, Sarasi will tell him about
ideals which will not come up until the distant future.
<br><br>Fig. 241: Ugefor (7Â° Scorpio) - This head controls the intellect
of man and directs all his intellectual faculties. Depending on
man's maturity and development, he makes him acquainted with
certain facts of knowledge. This also depends on the commission
which man has been charged with to fulfill on this earth. Ugefor
entrusts the magician with the manner by which human intellect
can be enlightened and how he can acquire an extraordinary
memory. All knowledge that can be grasped with the human intellect
is made accessible to the magician by this intelligence.
<br><br>Fig. 242: Armillee (8Â° Scorpio) - protects man against all infectious
diseases and causes him to look after himself, so that he is at
any time able to resist infection. If karmic reasons make it
necessary, or if it lies in one's fate, this head will not prevent an infection.
Armillee teaches the magician many means of protection
against the most diverse types of infectious diseases from the
magical point of view. Since there exists also the possibility of
mental or astral influence, Armillee also instructs the magician in
this respect: he teaches him how to protect himself, after having
been made acquainted with special magical practices, against
negative astral influences and against influences of negative bemgs.
<br><br>Fig. 243: Ranar (9Â° Scorpio) - All people dealing with spiritual
knowledge are protected by this head against obsession or any
other accompanying unfavourable psychic factors. This head has
at his disposal the most diverse methods which make communication
with the unseen of any sphere possible. He acquaints the
magician with the special practices of mental and astral travelling
and teaches him special ways of elevating his astral and mental
bodies into the various spheres. The magician can therefore
regard this intelligence as inspirer of various magical practices on
the path to perfection.
<br><br>Fig. 244: Caraschi (10Â° Scorpio) - protects and inspires all
human beings occupied with medical magnetism. Caraschi shows
the magician many methods in magical medicine, whether adtransfer
- vitalized life-magnetism - or Prana-treatment are concerned.
He learns these things without taking any risks. Whole
volumes could be written on the range of competence of this intelligence.
1t depends, however, on the magician's will whether he
wants to be inspired by this head and get first hand information.
<br><br>Fig. 245: Eralier (11Â° Scorpio) - will convince the magician that
the making of the philosopher's stone is no allegory and no
symbolic-esoteric speculation. The magician learns from this head
the preparation of the philosopher's stone in its most diverse
grades for the most various purposes. Furthermore, he will be
told the methods of transmuting metals, especially by dry procedure.
The person to some extent informed on alchemy will
already perceive what is meant by this. The preparation and
realization of the philosopher's stone rests on many methods.
Eralier can entrust the magician with these.
<br><br>Fig. 246: Sagara (12Â° Scorpio) - is the initiator of all magicians.
The magician who has got into contact with Sagara gets valuable
instruction on how to influence man and animal in the magical as
well as the quabbalistic - theurgic - manner.
<br><br>Fig. 247: Trasorim (13Â° Scorpio) - Sun is life. Man has been inspired
with this idea by this head. He has allowed mankind to
make inventions during the course of time which have brought
the use of the power of the sun. The magician is taught by
Trasorim to use the rays of the sun by application of coloured
filters for various medical methods. This intelligence may
therefore be regarded the initiator into the colour-light treatment.
Medicines which are influenced by the coloured light of the sun,
in analogy to the universal laws, show a better quality and capacity
and have a better dynamic effect than medicines produced in the
normal way. This head entrusts the magician with many magical
methods by which the coloured light of the sun cannot only be
applied for medical purposes and for dynamising medicines, but
which can, on top of that, be used for the most diverse magical
operations.
<br><br>Fig. 248: Schulego (14Â° Scorpio) - is a master of imitation in this
physical world. He has, for instance, taught man how to imitate
gems. The invention of glass, china, artificial leather, rubber and
many other synthetic artificial products is due to the inspiration
of this head. Assisted by Schulego, the magician can foresee in the
Akasha which human inventions are yet to come in respect of the
art of imitation and will, no doubt, agree that the reservoir of inventions
is limitless. Under the seal of secrecy, this intelligence
will also entrust the magician with the methods of their production.
<br><br>Fig. 249: Hipolopos (15Â° Scorpio) - All games serving the entertainment
of people of all races originate from the inspiration of
this head, and Hipolopos will remain being the initiator of all
games for young and old in the future for jokes, betts, sport
events, etc. This head is also the initiator of all toys for children.
Card games and other social games are, of course, also under his
competence.
<br><br>Fig. 250: Natolisa (16Â° Scorpio) - is the protector of the bees.
He has taught man the art of apiculture and how to use honey. In
the oldest days people had no sugar. They therefore used honey
instead. By Natolisa's inspiration man learned to produce various
kinds of sweets from honey. Later, when the raising of bees no
longer sufficed to cover the need for sweentening material,
Natolisa again caused man to win sugar from other substances
and made him find sugar-cane in the orient and sugar-beet in the
lands with a less favourable climate and these products have since
served as the raw-material for the making of sugar. The magician
may hear many interesting things about the production of sugar
or other sugar-like substances, which so far have not been known
to man. He may further be willingly told about the treatment of
diseases which are caused by the lack or excess of sugar in the
organism.
<br><br>Fig. 251: Butharusch (17Â° Scorpio) - It is the job of this head to
cause man not only to eat fruits in their raw state, but also to process
and tin them. He has taught man, during the course of time, to
prepare dishes by the help of the fire element, i. e. by roasting,
baking, stewing, etc.; furthermore, to bake bread, to make sweets,
to find new meat dishes; and he has led man up to the present
achievements of the art of cooking. Butharusch is therefore rightly
called the initiator into the art of cooking and baking.
<br><br>Fig. 252: Tagora (18Â° Scorpio) - is a master of erotic love. He is
responsible for the raising of sympathetic feelings between man
and woman and maintaining them. This head gives the magician
special instructions on how to make oneself loved by men and
women, how to evoke a person's sympathy, and if desired, how
to achieve peace in the family, etc. Tagora also knows many
magic means to evoke love and he can also inform the magician
about these.
<br><br>Fig. 253: Panari (19Â° Scorpio) - Metallurgic chemistry falls
under the competence of this head. He has taught man to gain
various metals from ores, has helped him with the recognition of
the various metallic elements, has taught him to produce metal
amalgams, etc. Panari has at his disposal various recipes for the
working up and amalgamating of metals, and also the decomposition
of metals into various chemical products, synthetic
substances and medicines. This intelligence will entrust the magician
with an almost unlimited number of secrets in this connection.
<br><br>Fig. 254: Nagar (20Â° Scorpio) - Similar to Panari, this head, too,
will teach the magician to make various medicines from the most
diverse types of metals and their combinations. Nagar is a great
inspirer of all medicines which can be produced by synthetic procedures.
A magician can increase his knowledge, if he allows
Nagar to teach him in which way certain metals can be used for
medicinal purposes.
<br><br>Fig. 255: Kofan (21Â° Scorpio) - He who open-heartedly refers to
this head will have all wishes fulfilled as far as is possible to him.
His speciality is to change bad living conditions into good ones
and to procure man's contentment. He informs the magician of
ways and means by which he can better his own living standard
and tells him to what extent his fate is karmically conditioned and
to what extent Divine Providence allows any interference. Since
the magician is, for the most part, master of his own fate, it will
usually be the fates of other people which the magician will want
to ameliorate with the help of this head.
<br><br>Fig. 256: Schaluach (22Â° Scorpio) - This head is equipped with
almost the same faculties and powers as the before mentioned one;
he renders man advice and assistance by intuition in even the
most difficult situations of life where, under normal conditions,
there is no possibility of escape. This intelligence finds the right
remedy in every situation and lets the magician know about it by
intuition.
<br><br>Fig. 257: Sipillipis (23Â° Scorpio) - is regarded as a special head
of the zone girdling the earth, since he can teach the magician the
power of faith and the power of conviction. Having acquired
these two divine faculties, the magician is capable of producing
the greatest wonders in the mental, astral and physical world.
Sipillipis advises the magician on how to reach quickly and safely
the power of faith and the power of conviction.
<br><br>Fig. 258: Tedea(24Â° Scorpio) - is an excellent expert in diagnosis
as well as in analysis and can teach the magician all causes of
diseases in the mental, astral and physical body. At the same time
he can make him acquainted with means which remove the causes
of disease and disharmony. The magician interested in medicine
can acquire such a great deal of knowledge from Tedea that he is
able to become an expert in diagnosis and medical treatment.
<br><br>Fig. 259: Semechle (25Â° Scorpio) - This head, too, initiates the
magician in all the methods of natural medicine, no matter
whether herbs, water treatment, care of the body or other
methods applied in natural medicine are concerned, or such items
which up to the present have remained completely unrevealed.
<br><br>Fig. 260: Radina (26Â° Scorpio) - is a special expert in theurgy, i.
e. quabbalah, and all theurgic methods for healing on this planet
are subject of his competence. He knows how the severest
diseases can be cured by quabbalah. He entrusts the magician
with many quabbalistic formulae for the curing of severe diseases,
so that the magician may compile a whole book of formulae for
his personal use. If the magician wants it, he will be trained by
Radina in curing people by miracles, i. e. by the help of quabbalah.
<br><br>Fig. 261: Hachamel (27Â° Scorpio) - is an excellent astronomical
expert and an expert in orientation. He has taught man to look
up to the stars and to fix the cardinal directions by their constellations.
This knowledge was formerly of especially great value in
navigation. Hachamel is also the original initiator of the compass
and the magnetic needle, without the knowledge of which navigation
would be impossible. In the course of time this head will
cause man to find other powers and inventions which will help
him with his orientation. All the measuring devices for measuring
the depth of the sea and pressure of water fall under the competence
of this head and will also be basically reformed in the
future.
<br><br>Fig. 262: Anadi (28Â° Scorpio) - is a specialist in hydrotherapy.
Like the thirtieth head of the zodiacal sign of the Libra called
Megalogi, Anadi, too, is responsible for all methods of water
treatment. He teaches the magician how to use the electromagnetic
fluid in connection with water for treating the most
various diseases. He also shows him how to remove the causes of
diseases by thermic stimulants and to create the dispositions of
harmony and health in the human body. This head informs the
magician about many methods of hydrotherapy which so far
have remained unrevealed, provided the magician is interested in
this field.
<br><br>Fig. 263: Horasul (29Â° Scorpio) - controls all artificial water
regulations on our earth. He inspires man how to make
use of the powers of water, how, for instance, to install an artificial
irrigation of the soil, or how to let water work artificially,
according to his wish, in a river bed. Horasul is the inspirer of the
most simple water mills as well as the most up to date hydroelectric
power stations, of the canals built for shipping, and the
like. He entrusts the magician with many novelties concerning
water regulation and the use of waters in the distant future.
<br><br>Fig. 264: Irmano (30Â° Scorpio) - Every creature living in the
water comes under the competence of this head. If, for instance,
the magician is interested in fishing, he can be given appropriate
methods by Irmano by the application of which he can cause fish
to gather at a certain place in order to catch them without difficulties,
or by which he is able to tame and control fish in such a
manner that they will allow him to take them into his hands; in
short, every animal living in the water, no matter whether seaserpent,
crocodile or shark is under his power.
<br>*
<br>The following thirty heads of the zone girdling the earth are
under the zodiacal sign of Sagittarius, and their seals have to be
drawn in blue colour.
<br><br>Fig. 265: Neschamah (1Â° Sagittarius) - By the intuition and inspiration
from this intelligence men have found the way to work
metals with the help of fire and water, i. e. to harden them, until
finally the present state of steel production and metal hardening
has been reached. During the course of time mankind will find
new, more complete procedures for the hardening of metals
which at present have to remain unknown.
<br><br>Fig. 266: Myrmo (2Â° Sagittarius) - Steam and the diverse
possibilities of its use have been introduced to man by this head,
whether the vaporization of liquids for manifold purposes or
the production of the most modern steam engines is concerned.
At the appropriate hour Myrmo will inspire many an inventor
with improvements, changes and novelties in this line.
<br><br>Fig. 267: Kathim (3Â° Sagittarius) - controls all fruits of the
earth. Without mankind knowing it, it was inspired by this head
not to eat fruit just in its natural state, i. e. at the moment of its
becoming ripe, but also to be blessed with the gifts of nature
when nature rests and when no fruits can be harvested. So it happened
that some types of fruits were merely dried at the beginning,
later they were cooked and conserved. Then man started using
fruits in yet another way: by working them up into jams,
juices, etc. Kathim's reservoir of recipes and novelties in the
utilization of fruits is almost unlimited.
<br><br>Fig. 268: Erimites (4Â° Sagittarius) - To bring peace to the earth
and amongst the peoples of the earth is the mission of this intelligence.
Ideals which aim at the true peace of mankind are led
and strengthened by Erimites. He is always pleased to entrust the
magician with the ways in which good influences can be produced
by the Akasha-principle, in order to awaken peaceful ideas.
<br><br>Fig. 269: Asinel (5Â° Sagittarius) - To bring good luck to
everybody is a pleasant mission, and Divine Providence has
charged this intelligence of the zone girdling the earth with it. A
magician who is in contact with Asinel can be sure that he will
have good luck everywhere when he is in need of it, no matter
whether it is in respect of love, gambling, or other affairs. But by
the help of this head or by the help of his subordinates, the magician
is not only able to bring happiness to himself alone; he can
also bring it to other people who do not deal with magic. Asinel
also lets the magician realize to what extent he can make use of
his own powers and how far the head himself is allowed to advance.
<br><br>Fig. 270: Geriola (6Â° Sagittarius) - Being a special expert in all
the virtues of morality on our earth, this head reveals to the magician
the genuine secrets of the magical equilibrium. He teaches
him the correct use of introspection and draws his attention to
faculties and powers which are the result of introspection. Having
carried out introspection according to instructions given by
Geriola in respect of himself and other people, the magician will
acquire great power of intuition and the genuine recognition of
the Akasha-principle. The magician may learn many facts of
wisdom from this intelligence and have them brought to his intellect.
<br><br>Fig. 271: Asoreg (7Â° Sagittarius) - The art of making pictorial
impressions in a manifold manner, whether by engraving, inscribing,
sewing, drawing, or painting, has been taught to the people
on earth by this head. Photography, cinema and film come
under the competence of this head, as well as television, on which
field there are still a great many inventions to come in the future.
Asoreg also instructs the magician how he can make pictures visible
over the greatest distances, so that even an untrained eye is
able to see them.
<br><br>Fig. 272: Ramage (8Â° Sagittarius) - has, apart from other things,
to control the influences of the 28 moon stations on our earth.
The best information on rhythm and periodicity can be got from
Ramage. He is always prepared to reveal to the magician the
secrets of the 28 moon stations and their influences on human life
in the physical, astral and mental aspects, and to show him, too,
how he can make practical use of all the knowledge gained by
him.
<br><br>Fig. 273: Namalon (9Â° Sagittarius) - protects all insane people
and, with the help of his subordinates, all those people who by
fate are not to be met with any evils. Lunatics are under his protection
so that during their fits nothing can happen to them; so
are people who suffer from St. Vitus's-Dance, epileptic fits, etc.
The magician learns from this head about the causes of all these
evils and also about the way in which they are successfully
treated.
<br><br>Fig. 274: Dimurga (10Â° Sagittarius) - is a guardian of travellers,
especially of those travelling by sea, by any kind of ship. Dimurga
is quite willing to inform the magician on individual talismans
and their manufacture which give shelter and help during travels.
If the magician is on board a ship and equipped with a protective
talisman of Dimurga, he will survive the strongest hurricane
without ever being in danger of drowning.
<br><br>Fig. 275: Golog (11Â° Sagittarius) - Being an excellent initiator
into the magic of evocation, this head initiates the magician into
secret methods concerning the evocation of all types of beings.
He will reveal to the highly ethically developed magician powerful
magic words which will force any being, no matter whether
positive or negative, to obey him absolutely. The magician may
further learn much from this intelligence about the synthesis of
the magic of evocation.
<br><br>Fig. 276: Ugali (12Â° Sagittarius) - Being an initiator into the
high magic which leads to the highest wisdom, this head is hard
to get into contact with, for he usually sends his subordinates to
deputize for him. Only a virtually perfect magician will succeed
in getting into direct contact with Ugali. If, however, the magician
has once succeeded in this, he has the best initiator into the
highest magic, especially spheric magic, at his disposal and will be
initiated by him into the most secret sciences that reveal to him
the highest wisdom.
<br><br>Fig. 277: Elason (13Â° Sagittarius) - is, like Ugali, hard to contact.
If the magician succeeds in doing so in spite of this, this high
initiator will reveal to him secret magical and quabbalistic
methods by which he will be able to realize all his high ideals.
<br><br>Fig. 278: Giria (14Â° Sagittarius) - Trade and monetary matters,
including the making of coins from all types of metals, fall under
the competence of this head. He has developed man in this
respect in accordance with his grade of maturity and the scheduled
time. He can give the magician information on all this.
<br><br>Fig. 279: Hosun (15Â° Sagittarius) - All kinds of educational
methods applied to young and old people originate from the inspiration
of this head, who at the same time is the originator of all
schools, starting from the oldest schools for prophets, and continuing
up to the present time. From Hosun the magician will
learn everything concerning the upbringing of children. The
magician asking this intelligence for help will be able to pass any
school examinations.
<br><br>Fig. 280: Mesah (16Â° Sagittarius) - is the originator of all
customs and rites of all the peoples all over the world, especially
those concerning wooing, love-making and marriage. He lets the
magician behold all customs and rites that have been in use from
the prime origin up to the present day and also those customs and
rites which he will cause people to use in the distant future.
<br><br>Fig. 281: Harkinon (17Â° Sagittarius) - All the orphans, all the
abandoned, expelled and hated are under the special protection of
this head. Depending on their Karma, he helpes them all bear
their lot more easily and helps in all the cases in which Divine
Providence allows it. A magician can get advice and help for people
like these from this head.
<br><br>Fig. 282: Petuno (18Â° Sagittarius) - is the guardian of all hunters
and all those people who are occupied with the chasing of wild
animals. He is the inspirer of appropriate weapons and other implements
necessary for catching game or wild animals.
<br><br>Fig. 283: Caboneton (19Â° Sagittarius) Astronomy, astrology and
all affiliated sciences come under the competence of this head. He
explains to the magician in detail the synthesis of astronomy and
astrology. By the help of Caboneton the magician learns to know
the visible part of the universe, i. e. the starry sky and is instructed
in the influences and effects of the constellations on our
earth, on the fate of the individual and on the fate of whole nations.
<br><br>Fig. 284: Echagi (20Â° Sagittarius) - gives help and advice in case
of malicious diseases like epilepsy, cancer; diseases of the spinal
cord, St. Vitus's-Dance, etc., the causes of which have not been
found up to this date and which therefore are still regarded as incurable.
Echagi lets the magician recognize the causes of severe
and hidden diseases and at the same time entrusts him with
methods for the production of appropriate means to cure them.
<br><br>Fig. 285: Batirunos (21Â° Sagittarius) - To give bliss, peace,
pleasure and delight to man is the special commission of this
head. Everything that makes man happy is caused by this inspirer
of happy moments, or by his subordinates. The magician will
have all such questions put to Batirunos answered to his fullest
satisfaction.
<br><br>Fig. 286: Hillaro (22Â° Sagittarius) - is a representative of
justice. He can fulfill for the magician everything that requires
true justice, no matter whether in legal or any other affairs. The
magician will get this head's full assistance in all judicial matters.
<br><br>Fig. 287: Ergomion (23Â° Sagittarius) - is an inspirer of the
science of colour and instructs the magician thoroughly not only
in the production of colours, but also in their mixing. If the magician
is interested in painting, he can get unsurpassable recipes for
mixing colours, inks, drawing-inks, etc., in respect of their production
as well as their practical application. Ergomion is also an
expert in synthetic, inorganic chemistry and can also inform the
magician in this line.
<br><br>Fig. 288: Ikon (24Â° Sagittarius) - reveals to the magician the
mysteries of the magical equilibrium of body, soul and spirit in
their relation to the Akasha-principle. He also explains to the
magician what genuine introspection is, how important it is for
the achievement of the magic equilibrium and that without introspection
a physical, psychic and spiritual training, a true
recognition of the universal truths is impossible.
<br><br>Fig. 289: Alosom (25Â° Sagittarius) - guards the deep secrets of
silence and the powers and faculties produced by silence as a
negative state. Alosom is thus the head of the magic of silence.
<br><br>Fig. 290: Gezero (26Â° Sagittarius) - is the leader of human conscience,
of its arousal in man at the given time or in certain situations.
The magician knows that any expression of conscience is
an expresssion of the Akasha-principle which declares itself by
the inner voice in man. Gezero and his subordinates usually see
that even the greatest criminal experiences pricks of conscience
which lead him to reason.
<br><br>Fig. 291: Agasoly (27Â° Sagittarius) - Phenomenal magic comes
under the competence of this head, who can give the magician
hints, instructions and even practical assistance in this respect.
Assisted by Agasoly and his subordinates, the magician is able to
bring about the most incredible magical phenomena. It is Agasoly
who has inspired man to copy many an occult phenomenon by
technical inventions. He is therefore regarded as the original initiator
of all magical apparatus. The latter are being used by
amateurs and sorcerers on the stage who, by deception of the
senses and by manual skill, try to lead the spectators to believe
that they are in possession of genuine magic powers and faculties.
With Agasoly's help the magician is able to make many a
technical invention by which other occult phenomena can be imitated.
<br><br>Fig. 292: Ekore (28Â° Sagittarius) - is a leader of the fate of every
human being. The magician who evokes this head will be able to
realize by his assistance the difference between destiny and free
will. Ekore is, no doubt, in the position to change the fate of any
person, should the magician ask him to do so. He may let the
magician know how far his personal free will is going in respect
of a certain task.
<br><br>Fig. 293: Saris (29Â° Sagittarius) - teaches the magician the magic
charging of talismans and amulets by the projection of accumulated
light or accumulated elements. He also gives the magician
exact information on how to ban beings of the various
spheres.
<br><br>Fig. 294: Elami (30Â° Sagittarius) - and his subordinates care for
all the waters situated unter the earth's surface. From this head the
magician can learn how and to what extent subterranean mineral
springs can be found without having to use any of the usual
location-apparatus. By the help of this intelligence the magician is
able to find drinking-water even in the driest desert without the
use of a divining rod, providing, of course, that there is any water
at all under the surface of the earth nearby. Under Elami's protection
are all workers who are occupied with the detection and
utilization of subterranean waters.
<br>*
<br>Below are found the thirty heads of the zone girdling the earth
subject to the zodiacal sign of Capricorn. Their seals are to be
drawn in black colour.
<br><br>Fig. 295: Milon (1Â° Capricorn) - introduces the magician to
Divine Magic, especially the Magic of the Akasha, and teaches
him how to produce consciously, in the Akasha, various causes in
the magical manner in order to bring about certain effects in the
mental, astral and physical world. As soon as the magician completely
controls this kind of magical practice, he is able to produce
causes in the Akasha-principle long before their realization,
even many years before their realization. By this the magician
becomes a perfect master in the field of fatecontrol and has his
own Karma as well as the Karma of other people well in his
hands. Considering his ethical development, the magician will
never produce any causes which would have negative effects in
any of the three planes. Such a magician will be entrusted with
such a great number of secrets which he would have never
thought possible.
<br><br>Fig. 296: Melamo (2Â° Capricorn) - helps the magician to elevate
his own personality, thus putting him in front of the spiritual
powers and thereby enabling him to influence man and animal
at his personal will. Melamo knows magical practices by which
one can procede to the highest plane of power. Should the magician
be interested in increasing his own power, Melamo and his
subordinates will be pleased to give him their assistance.
<br><br>Fig. 297: Porphora (3Â° Capricorn) - Like many other heads of
the zone girdling the earth of whom mention has already been
made, Porphora is an excellent initiator into the magic of sympathy
and into mummial magic. Each head will provide the magician
with different instructions and methods for his practical
operations. Porphora informs the magician of many practices so
far unknown to him, for instance, the use of fluid condensers in
sympathetic magic etc.
<br><br>Fig. 298: Trapi (4Â° Capricorn) - helps man bear the blows of
fate and disappointments more easily, especially in respect of
friendship, love and marriage. The magician in connection with
this head has therefore never to fear any such disappointments in
life.
<br><br>Fig. 299: Jonion (5Â° Capricorn) - is regarded as the mysterious
head of the zone girdling the earth. He is the guardian of all those
already in the next world making preparations for their reincarnation.
In the invisible world, i. e. the zone girdling the earth,
where the deceased live, he attributes to those beings who are to
be reincarnated in our physical world the place and surroundings
suited to their development. He also instructs them how to produce
the band of sympathy between themselves and the ripening
fruit in the mother's womb.
<br><br>Fig. 300: Afolono (6Â° Capricorn) - being the ruler of the Mercurian
Quabbalah, this head instructs the magician in the quabbalistic
transposition of the influences of the Mercurian sphere to
the zone girdling the earth, and from there to our physical world,
on the mental and astral, as well as the physical bodies. From
Afolono the magician may also learn how to acquire a specially
receptive mind, i. e. the enlightenment with all the fields of science
of our earth.
<br><br>Fig. 301: Paruchu (7Â° Capricorn) - All those people will find an
excellent inspirer in this head who deal with drama, tragedy, etc.
either as writers or as actors. If the magician is himself devoted to
these arts, Paruchu will offer him many possibilities for becoming
a famous artist.
<br><br>Fig. 302: Pormatho (8Â° Capricorn) - is in charge of all earth
radiation in our physical world. The magician is told by this head
which earth rays he can use for his and for other people's benefit
and which have a harmful influence on one's health. He also informs
him how to protect himself against the malicious influence
of earth rays. Apart from this, technology is indebted to this head
for the inspirations in respect of all apparatuses which have so far
come into use for measuring earth rays of all kinds.
<br><br>Fig. 303:Ampholion (9Â° Capricorn) - initiates the magician into
the whole anatomy of the astral bodies of man and animal. The
magician also learns from him the scientific facts of occult
anatomy and how to make practical use of these in magic. Ampholion
is therefore to be regarded as the teacher of occult
anatomy, and the magician may learn much from him in this
respect.
<br><br>Fig. 304: Kogid (10Â° Capricorn) - is one of the best initiators on
the path to genuine cognition. He controls the learning of each
man according to his degree of maturity and provides him with
the necessary enlightenment on his path to cognition. He entrusts
the magician with the methods which lead to enlightenment and
omniscience. Kogid is the guardian angel of all students of
spiritual knowledge, especially of those dealing with Inana-Y oga,
the Yoga of genuine cognition.
<br><br>Fig. 305: Cermiel (11Â° Capricorn) - Like Jonion, the fifth head
of this zodiacal sign, Cermiel has also been appointed by Divine
Providence to control the incarnation or reincarnation of every
human being. He knows how long each individual must dwell in
the invisible world in order to become mature for his rebirth on
our earth, for his further attending the school of life. Cermiel can
reveal to the magician many secrets in respect of the life and death
of any human being. If requested, he will also tell the magician
about the exact moment of his own death as well as the deaths of
other people, and, likewise, the time and place of reincarnation.
<br><br>Fig. 306: Erimihala (12Â° Capricorn) - controls the higher astral
magic and can therefore reveal to the mature magician many
secrets of the invisible world. For instance, he informs him of the
effects of elements on the astral plane; how the abandoned astral
body whose spirit has already been reincarnated in our world is
slowly dissolved by the astral elements. He can enrich the magician's
knowledge with many other facts regarding the workings
and doings of the elements in the astral world.
<br><br>Fig. 307: Trisacha (13Â° Capricorn) - has many methods at his
disposal to bring about a quick development of television and
teaches the magician how to overcome time and space in a simple
manner. Trisacha is the initiator of all optical implements and
allows one to see, in the Akasha, new inventions that are to take
place in the distant future. Thus it will, for instance, eventually be
possible to transmit and receive with only a small apparatus. This
apparatus need only be directed to any spot on our earth and one
will be able to see everything taking place at that place. The people
to be watched will not need a transmitter or receiver and,
what is even more astonishing, they will not know that they are
being watched. Television today is only at the beginning of its
development. Before this head allows such or similar inventions
to become known to the public, mankind must go through further
spiritual and psychic development. At the moment such inventions
would only be misused by man. What a magician is
already able to see by tele-vision i. e. the seeing regardless of time
and space due to his fully developed clairvoyant eyes, will eventually
also be possible for the average human being in a purely
physical way, due to appropriate inventions made by then. The
future will bring the proof of these statements.
<br><br>Fig. 308: Afimo (14Â° Capricorn) - is an original inspirer in
respect of physics and chemistry, and the people who have to do
with the invention and production of gases of all kinds are under
the special protection of this head. Afimo initiates the magician
into the secrets of evaporation in nature, into the absorbing of liquids,
and the return of water in the form of rain and snow. All
the physical procedures in our physical world having to do with
evaporation of any kind are controlled by this head. Furthermore,
the magician learns from him how to produce rain and fog
in nature and how to stop them and make them disappear. He is
also taught how to turn liquids and solid forms into gas. Afimo
makes it possible for the magician to behold inventions which
will not be allowed to be made known to the public until the
most distant future.
<br><br>Fig. 309: Garses (15Â° Capricorn) - Similar to Pormatho, the
eight head of this zodiacal sign, controlling the earth rays and the
relevant measuring instruments, Garses, too, is capable of
teaching the magician the magical practice of locating earth rays;
especially their magical detection by the help of divining rods,
pendulums and other aids without the use of complicated measuring
instruments. The magician is given exact information by this
intelligence on new and so far unknown methods of detection.
<br><br>Fig. 310: Masadu (16Â° Capricorn) - inspires mankind to be
economical, and teaches man to put aside reserves for hard times
and for winter. He endows the magician with the faculty of finding
out in advance the times of bad harvests, of famines etc., and
offers protection by his subordinates, so that the magician will
never suffer from any emergency.
<br><br>Fig. 311: Arabim (17Â° Capricorn) - is capable of informing the
magician of occult botany and all its related fields. This head
teaches the magician to understand botany from the hermetic
point of view and to make practical use of it in magic and
medicine.
<br><br>Fig. 312: Amia (18Â° Capricorn) - controls all crystallisations on
and under the surface of the earth. All kings of gnomes and their
subordinates are ruled by this head of the zone girdling the earth.
Amia allows the magician to penetrate further into the facts and
effects of crystallisation and shows him where crystals, rockcrystals,
and various kinds of salt, precious stones and semiprecious
stones are to be found. If the magician is mature enough
and has reached a certain degree in his magical development, he is
taught, besides other things, by this intelligence how to turn
crystalline compounds into semi-precious and precious stones in
the alchemical manner.
<br><br>Fig. 313: Kamual (19Â° Capricorn) - controls all ores and coal
mines of this world. He is the initiator of all people having to do
with the mining of ores and coal. Therefore all miners, mining
engineers and mining experts are under his protection. If the
magician is interested in this field, this head will assist him abundantly
by giving him a wealth of most valuable information.
<br><br>Fig. 314: Parachmo (20Â° Capricorn) - makes man acquainted
with all kinds of herbs of our earth and is the special protector of
those who gather herbs. The magician is taught by this head how
to make out of herbs in the alchemical-spagiric manner medicines
for various types of diseases, including so-called incurable ones.
From Parachmo the magician learns about alchemical-spagiric
essences and quintessences, the production of which is only
known up to this date to a few initiates. The magician may learn
more from Parachmo than he thinks or believes possible.
<br><br>Fig. 315: Cochaly (21Â° Capricorn) - sportsmen of all types,
especially hunters and mountaineers, are under the protection of
this intelligence. To seek contact with Colachy will bring plentiful
results to the magician interested in sports. He will, for instance,
learn how to make his body extremely adaptable in sports,
so that his performances will become outstanding.
<br><br>Fig. 316: Ybario (22Â° Capricorn) - is regarded a special custodian
of Divine Justice, for he controls the doings of negative
powers in the whole zone girdling the earth as well as on our
planet in all three planes, i. e. in the mental, astral and physical
world. This head sees to it that the negative powers never get the
upper hand and that no chaos in created in these spheres, which,
if it so happened, would have to be again equalized by the positive
powers. Ybario's basic qualities are harmony and justice.
<br><br>Fig. 317: Lotifar (23Â° Capricorn) - This head has to carry out a
difficult task in the zone girdling the earth. It is his job to prevent
people from committing suicide by warning them through their
inner voice and by diverting them, if possible, from their plans.
By the help of his subordinates he inspires people who are in
hopeless misery, distress or disappointment, with the fact that life
is something holy and cannot be replaced by anything. Lotifar
has saved millions of people from suicide by way of intuition, by
having inspired them with a good idea, or by having created a
situation which drove away their suicidal thoughts at the last moment.
People who could not be diverted from their plans and
who layed hands on oneself are watched by Lotifar and his subordinates
so that they do not re-gain their complete consciousness
in the astral world before their normal life-time on this earth has
elapsed. When the suicide awakes from his state of twilight sleep,
another head who is responsible for the reincarnation of man,
starts looking after him. That head then sees to it that the suicide
is embodied into circumstances under which he is able to catch up
truly what he should have learned on earth by his fate. Every person
planning suicide should be reasonable that it really is a great
foolishness to wish to make a premature end to one's life, for by
this act of will one cannot change one's fate in any way; quite the
contrary is the case: one merely prolongs unnecessarily the time
of the training and schooling of one's spirit, and at the same time
prolongs one's suffering.
<br><br>Fig. 318: Kama (24Â° Capricron) - is a ruler of the physical atmosphere
of our earth. He controls the drifts of air, warmth and
cold, and fixes the pre-conditions for vegetation. Cold and warmth,
heat dryness, storms, frosts, all fall under this head's great range of
competence. The atmosphere, too, has its secrets, and there will
hardly be anyone with right ideas about this. Kama is quite
prepared to reveal them all to a genuine magician.
<br><br>Fig. 319: Segosel (25Â° Capricorn) - reveals to the magician the
secret of the matter of our physical world in its chemical and
physical effects. The magician can get information from this head
in everything related to our physical world.
<br><br>Fig. 320: Sarsiee (26Â° Capricorn) - is a mysterious head of the
zone girdling the earth, and every magician is especially interested
in him, for he is the custodian of all magical keys and therefore
strictly sees to it that these keys, by which enormous powers and
faculties can be released, never get into the hands of immature
people. Sarsiee personally sees to it that the true mysteries remain
hidden to the non-initiate even if they are published in hundreds
of books. This head therefore may justly be regarded as the custodian
of magical keys.
<br><br>Fig. 321: Kiliosa (27Â° Capricorn) - is a magical assistant in
moments of great distress. The magician who has at any time
been in contact with this head is always helped instantly by him
in moments of great distress and highest danger to life. Kiliosa entrusts
the magician, if he is mature enough in this respect, with
quabbalistic words of power which may only be applied in
moments of utmost danger to life, but which save the magician's
life at once. So, for instance, a murderer will die as soon as a certain
powerful word is uttered, or the magician will become invisible
or escape in some other lucky way by another word. Many
other difficult situations can be changed by such words of power.
Sometimes the effects are realized within tenths of seconds. No
magician practising magical evocation will therefore fail to get
also into contact with this head of the zone girdling the earth in
order to be informed of words of power to help him in moments
of great danger.
<br><br>Fig. 322: Rosora (28Â° Capricorn) - is a master of acoustics in
our physical world. Mankind owes its hitherto existing progress
in acoustic communication over far distances to this head's inspirations,
starting from the "tomtom" of primitive peoples up to
modern telephone and radio communications and all other inventions
in this field. From the magic point of view, the magician
may be shown by this intelligence the way in which everything
to which the magician directs his attention can be heard over
greatest distances i. e. by clairaudience; furthermore how acoustic
vibration can be materialized over great distance, i. e. how spoken
words, sentences, etc., can be intensified acoustically and thus
heard over the greatest distances. If the magician reaches a certain
degree of perfection in this, he can so materialize this
phenomenon that even magically untrained people are able to
hear the spoken words with their physical ears. The magician
will also be given exact information on many other phenomena
refering to acoustic transposition over distances.
<br><br>Fig. 323: Ekorim (29Â° Capricorn) - has been teaching mankind
from its prime origin how to create the most manifold shapes
from earth, gypsum, clay. In accordance with its development
Ekorim has inspired mankind to make pots, vessels, statues, and
the like, from clay. Later he taught man to make bricks from
clay, which up to this day have been an important constituent in
architecture. The magician may not only be informed of
everything in connection with the working up of clay, he may
also be told about the healing power of clay in natural medicine
and may learn which other natural means are to be added to the
clay in order to bring about certain curative effects. Hitherto unknown
curing methods in this line, which will be revealed to man
in the future, will be shown to the magician by Ekorim.
<br><br>Fig. 324: Ramgisa (30Â° Capricorn) - The directing and controlling
of the fish trade is the prevalent task of this head. It is Ramgisa
who has taught mankind to tin water animals in various ways,
and the magician can get a wealth of information on this subject
from the above named head.
<br>*
<br>The next thirty heads of the zone girdling the earth fall under
the competence of the zodiacal sign of Aquarius, and their seals
have to be drawn in violet colour.
<br><br>Fig. 325: Frasis (1Â° Aquarius) - This head has taught mankind
how to sharpen things. First man learned to sharpen his knives,
axes, swords and all other weapons, then, as the time went on, he
also learned how to cut stones and gems. The instrument
necessary for the sharpening and cutting, the whetstone, has
reached its modern perfection due to inspiration by this head.
Frasis is the guardian of all people having to do with the art of
cutting, sharpening and grinding.
<br><br>Fig. 326: Pother (2Â° Aquarius) - is a master of the art of war.
This, of course, does not mean that he deludes mankind to start
wars, quite the contrary: this head secures peace and teaches, by
inspiration, how those attacked by an enemy can direct wars
successfully. Pother is also the initiator into all means of protection
against an enemy. He may rightly be regarded as a strategist
in the art of war.
<br><br>Fig. 327: Badet (30 Aquarius) - To inspire man with the creative
power of imagination is the object of this head of the zone girdling
the earth. The magician with too little imagination should address
this intelligence, from whom he will get assistance in this
respect. The methods Badet will entrust the magician with will
give the latter a marvelous faculty of imagination and, apart from
this, he will learn how to think in a creative manner and how to
transpose certain thoughts into the Akasha in order to realize the
results he wants to see.
<br><br>Fig. 328: Naga (4Â° Aquarius) - Being an inspirer of poetry, this
head will help the magician to acquire a good sense of judgement
and the talent of composing. Since Naga prefers spiritual and
psychic motives in poetry, the magician may be enabled, by
following Naga's instructions, to express all spiritual problems in
verse and poetry in an easy manner.
<br><br>Fig. 329: Asturel (5Â° Aquarius) - represents Divine Mercy and,
by his pleasant oscillation, makes everybody bear his lot more
easily. He likes to help in all cases where assistance is possible
without disturbing legality. The magician, too, may refer to this
head for help for other people. Apart from this, Asturel makes
the magician realize the borders of legality and mercy from the
universal point of view.
<br><br>Fig. 330: Liriell (6Â° Aquarius) - is an original initiator into
cosmic philosophy and teaches the magician the most various
philosophies from the prime origin up to the present day. Being
enabled by Liriell to look into the distant future, the magician
learns about the philosophies of the days to come. The magician
can, by the help of this intelligence, accumulate an intellectual
knowledge of philosophies of an unimaginable depth.
<br><br>Fig. 331: Siges (7Â° Aquarius) - This head informs the magician
of the various procedures for mummification which will stop the
dissolving influence on the astral and the physical body. If the
magician applies these procedures, he will stop getting old and
will so evade the influence of his fate; for he is able to prolong his
life for the period he wants to have it prolonged. Also, the magician
who has mummified himself astrally and physically can never
be taken ill. Following the instructions of this head, the magician
will be able to experiment in many other matters. He can, for instance,
make himself invulnerable against fire, water, poison, or
he can live without food for many years, or remain young,
energetic and resistant as long as he wants. Divine Providence
alone may decide on the life and death of such a magician.
<br><br>Fig. 332: Metosee (8Â° Aquarius) - Manual skill comes under the
domain of this head. He is responsible for skill in profession as
well as in art. He influences all the manual work done by women,
for instance, embroidering, knitting, crochetting, sewing, spinning,
and all other work that needs a certain manual skill. The
magician is given methods by this intelligence how to raise such
talents which require precise manual skill.
<br><br>Fig. 333: Abusis (9Â° Aquarius) - This head assists all those people
who seek the truth. Depending on their individual development,
he causes the seekers to come into the environment of people
initiated into spiritual knowledge. He even makes it possible
for them to get into touch with a genuine Guru - spiritual
teacher - who then initiates them into the truths they longed to
learn about.
<br><br>Fig. 334: Panfodra (10Â° Aquarius) - can reveal to the magician
the most secret methods for individual spiritual development.
This head decides which secret method for the spiritual development
is to be unveiled and made public to each individual seeker.
Like many other heads, Panfodra, too, is an excellent initiator into
true magic and is a custodian of the keys to the magicquabbalistic
secrets.
<br><br>Fig. 335: Hagus (11Â° Aquarius) - Besides many methods in
magic which the magician may learn about from this head, he is
also given exact information on mental, astral and physical radiation.
Hagus teaches the magician how to tell from the radiation
emitted from a human being the degree of maturity of his mental
and astral body. This head of the zone girdling the earth has in his
hands special methods for the multifarious practical magical exploitation
of these radiations, and he is quite prepared to tell the
qualified magician about them.
<br><br>Fig. 336: Hatuny (12Â° Aquarius) - During his wanderings
through the zone girdling the earth or practising evocation the
magician certainly will not fail to get into contact with this head,
this excellent initiator into quabbalistic magic, for by him he will
be told how to apply quabbalistic magic in all three planes; the
mental, astral and physical plane. Hatuny has at his disposa:l
secret practices in quabbalistic magic which so far he has revealed
only to a few initiates.
<br><br>Fig. 337: Gagolchon (13Â° Aquarius) - is an inspirer of all explorers
of nature on our earth. According to the development and
maturity of mankind, he unveils successively the secrets of
nature. The magician dealing with natural science will certainly
want to get into contact with this head, who, by apt means, will
awake in the magician extraordinary genius in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 338: Baja (14Â° Aquarius) - This head inspires writers
writing on mysticism, occultism and spiritual science of any kind,
gives them wonderful inspirations to bring to paper mysterious
facts in poetry or beautiful verse. Also playwrights of mystical
pieces will be assisted in their work by this intelligence. The
magician who is also a writer will get many inspirations for his
work from this head.
<br><br>Fig. 339: Ugirpon (15Â° Aquarius) - This head, who also is an excellent
initiator into astrophysics, can inform the magician about
astronomy and its influence on the mental, astral and physical
planes. Ugirpon likes to tell a mature magician about the inhabitants
of other planets, about their spiritual development and
maturity, about their technical achievements, in short, about
everything which the magician considers worth knowing.
<br><br>Fig. 340: Capipa (16Â° Aquarius) - is known as the custodian of
wealth, riches and reputation. He and his servants are the custodians
of all treasures situated under the earth, precious stones as
well as the treasures hidden away by human hands. If the magician
wants to become rich quickly, without the riches becoming a
hindrance to his spiritual development - which fact can best be
found out by the head himself who in this case would tell the
magician about it - he can be sure that Capipa will see that he acquires
the desired riches.
<br><br>Fig. 341: Koreh (17Â° Aquarius) - Like many other heads,
Koreh, too, is an excellent initiator into quabbalistic mysticism.
Concerning the spiritualisation of divine virtues in the mental,
astral and physical world, he will make the magician acquainted
with special methods, so that by following these methods the latter
will be able to make use of all his acquired magical-quabbalistic
faculties when helping other people.
<br><br>Fig. 342: Somi (18Â° Aquarius) - The magician can be initiated
into many magical-alchemical secrets, especially regarding the
preparation of fluid condensers for different magical practices. If
Somi considers the magician mature enough he - being an expert
in the most secret sexual magic, the magic of love, - will also
teach the magician how to charge these condensers efficiently. In
this respect the magician can be initiated into high mysteries by
Somi, which so far, no doubt, have been completely unknown to
him.
<br><br>Fig. 343: Erytar (19Â° Aquarius) - Is an excellent expert on and
initiator into alchemy and electrophysics who introduces to the
magician special procedures. For instance, how by the help of the
electromagnetic fluid the electronic oscillation of metals can be
changed at will and how, by this procedure, the original elements
of the metal are changed. Erytar teaches the magician how to
make use of electrophysics in magic, so that various effects are
brought about not only in the physical, but also in the astral and
in the mental plane.
<br><br>Fig. 344: Kosirma (20Â° Aquarius) - makes the magician acquainted
with special curing methods for diseases which up to the
present have been regarded as incurable. This head entrusts the
magician with many recipes and methods for the preparation of
alchemical and spagiric medicines to cure all kinds of severe
diseases and he also teaches him how, on top of that, to influence
favourably these medicines by the help of the electromagnetic
fluid and other ways of charges. The magician can get from this
head, information on all secret alchemical curing methods.
<br><br>Fig. 345:Jenuri (21Â° Aquarius) - By this head the magician is informed
about all kinds of protective means and protective
measures against any negative influence, whether it comes from
negative elementals, elementaries, beings of elements, beings of
the zone girdling the earth, or from any other negative beings of
any other sphere. This head can tell the magician all protective
measures for the most different kinds of magic practice, evocation,
etc., where negative influences must be feared. Following
the instruction given by this intelligence, the magician will also
learn to make for his own use protective amulets, protective
talismans, magic lightning conductors, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 346: Altono (22Â° Aquarius) Similar to Asturel, the fifth head
of this zodiacal sign, Altono, too, decides about justice and injustice.
He always sees that the magician is not wronged, no matter
whether in court or with his fellow-men. Altono also consoles
all rightless people, all persecuted persons, innocent imprisoned
men, etc. By force of his vibration he sees that these people get
the blessings of benevolence and, by this, inner peace. He is, at
the same time, a helper in difficult situations in a person's life.
<br><br>Fig. 347: Chimirgu (23Â° Aquarius) - initiates the magician who
is in contact with him into the mysteries of Creation in respect of
all planes and spheres. By this intelligence the magician learns to
know thoroughly the Akasha-principle, i.e. the principle of
causes, and by this the mysteries of wisdom are unveiled to him.
<br><br>Fig. 348: Arisalea (24Â° Aquarius) - Being a perfect master of
magical incarnation, this head awakens within the magician his
understanding of the music of the spheres and teaches him how to
express by music or song every idea, every thought. Following
the methods given to him by Arisaka, the magician can develop
an excellent ear for music.
<br><br>Fig. 349: Boreb (25Â° Aquarius) - is known as the judge of the
whole zone girdling the earth. His commission is to control
strictly, by his subordinates, the oaths taken by human beings on
earth, no matter whether they are oaths taken before a court or
whether they are oaths of loyalty, love, etc. It is by this head that
the magician learns to understand fully what it means to take an
oath, especially a magic oath, and what can be achieved by keeping
a magic oath. Boreb also tells the magician in which cases an
oath may be broken without any karmic consequences for the
magician, and the magician will be instructed by him in many
other things in this line.
<br><br>Fig. 350: Soesma (26Â° Aquarius) - is an expert in universal ritual
magic and likes to reveal to magicians the secrets of all magicalquabbalistic
rituals. By the help of this head of the zone girdling
the earth the magician acquires the most genuine knowledge of
individual rituals, the rituals of a whole society, and, furthermore,
of those bound to a demiurge, i. e. a personified god, or to a
certain religious system, rituals which express the cosmic analogy,
which indicate that they are of universal origin, and so forth. If,
for a special reason, the magician needs a suitable ritual, he only
has to contact this intelligence.
<br><br>Fig. 351: Ebaron (27Â° Aquarius) - entrusts the magician with
special methods which not only refer to mental and astral wandering
in the three planes, i. e. the mental, astral and physical world,
but which also facilitate travels to the other spheres. If he wishes,
the magician can cause this head or his subordinates to accompany
him on his mental and astral travels, in the zone girdling the earth
as well as in other spheres, and by doing this he can learn about
the laws and mysteries of each individual sphere. This head also
informs the magician about the magic handling of these laws.
<br><br>Fig. 352: Negani (28Â° Aquarius) - Like Ebaron, the head just
mentioned, Negani, too, can acquaint the magician with the
secrets of the magical quabbalah of the spheres and entrust him
for his practical work with apt methods concerning the magic of
spheres in all three planes. To each magician who succeeds in getting
into contact with this intelligence will be revealed unthought
of possibilities.
<br><br>Fig. 353: Nelion (29Â° Aquarius) - This head's knowledge of
analogy, i. e. the laws of synthetic alchemy, magic and quabbalah
is by no means inferior to the two before named heads. This
means that the magician is equally well off, if he entrusts himself
to this head's guidance. Nelion helps the magician to enrich his
knowledge with the help of many a method that so far has been
unkown.
<br><br>Fig. 354: Sirigilis (30Â° Aquarius) - is a special initiator into, and
at the same time custodian of, high mysteries concerning
alchemy. By this head the magician is taught how to impregnate,
for special purposes, the seed and blood of man in various ways.
To try and succeed in getting into contact with this head, will
mean from the hermetic point of view rich gains for any magician.
<br>*
<br>A short descirption of the last thirty heads of the zone girdling
the earth, who come under the zodiacal sign of Pisces and whose
seals are to be drawn in blue colour, follows below.
<br><br>Fig. 355: Haja (1Â° Pisces) - To raise the creative powers in all
three planes, special secret methods are applied. This head knows
about them and is quite willing to inform the magician of them. If
the magician carefully follows the instructions given by this intelligence,
he will soon be able to raise the dynamics neccessary
for practising quabbalistic magic and to do this without danger.
Haja will prove to be an excellent teacher for the magic of powers
and the magician, apart form hearing about other facts, will learn
from him, for instance, how to condense various types of fluids to
bring about phenomenal effects.
<br><br>Fig. 356: Schad (2Â° Pisces) - constantly endeavours to facilitate,
as far as possible, what man has to do in this world; thus, for instance,
he inspires suitable persons with technical inventions of
all kinds which are likely to replace manual work by machines.
<br><br>Fig. 357: Kohen (3Â° Pisces) - also inspires man with new
technical inventions with a special predeliction for technical inventions
in the field of agriculture. If the magician is interested,
this head lets him behold, in the Akasha-principle, the progress in
agricultural technology, which in the far distant future will
facilitate man's work.
<br><br>Fig. 358: Echami (4Â° Pisces) - controls the doings of human beings
on earth and is therefore able to explain to the magician the
secrets of the Karma-Yoga. To practise true Karma-Yoga means
to carry out good deeds for no other reason but for themselves
and by no means in order to get any kind of reward for doing so.
Echami's teaching will make the magician realize how unselfish
deeds are valued from the point of view of the Akasha-principle
and are rewarded with various kinds of magical faculties and with
delivery from the Karma. Having learned this, every magician
will certainly long for situations which give him a chance for doing
unselfish deeds. Such situations can be procured for the magician
by Echami and his subordinates.
<br><br>Fig. 359: Flabison (5Â° Pisces) - All kinds of arts, entertainments,
pleasures and well-being and happiness fall under Flabison's competence.
He can help the magician by bringing about situations -
if the latter wishes it - which bring good entertainment. If the
magician himself is in need of recreation and enjoyment, in order
to relax from his magic studies, which always require a state of
seriousness, he should refer to this head, for he will prove the best
guide in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 360: Alagill (6Â° Pisces) - With the help of this head the
magician will be thoroughly successful in his profession. Alagill
especially likes to help in the case of the arts and craft trades.
However, since success alone in one's work is not enough, this intelligence
secures for man also financial success. Therefore, the
magician should regard this head an assistant in all material matters
and he can be sure that he will never be denied his assistance.
<br><br>Fig. 361: Atherom (7Â° Pisces) - brings good luck in all fields of
science, success in learning and in any kind of intellectual work.
He also helps everybody, either by his direct influence or by the
influence of his subordinates, in getting the material he needs for
his studies. If the magician wishes it, this intelligence will make
him omniscient in any field of science, so that nothing will remain
an unrevealed secret to him.
<br><br>Fig. 362: Porascho (8Â° Pisces) - This head has a similar range of
competence as the foregoing one, with the only difference that he
supports man in acquiring his knowledge at school whereas
Atherom helps him acquire knowledge by private studies.
Porascho therefore can make himself useful in cases of schoolexaminations
and courses, should the magician need the assistance
of this intelligence for someone who himself is not a magician.
<br><br>Fig. 363: Egention (9Â° Pisces) - Everything refering to or connected
with travelling comes under this head's range of power.
The magician refering to this intelligence will always be a furtunate
traveller and will succeed in everything planned by him
and he will be safe of having any kind of accident whilst travelling,
regardless whether he travels on the continent, over the
water or through the air. When carrying this head's seal with
him, the magician can never be met with a traffic accident.
<br><br>Fig. 364: Siria (10Â° Pisces) - Special occult methods revealed to
the magician by this head will bring him - depending on his
degree of maturity - happiness, wealth, honour, riches and
respect without influencing his Karma in a negative way. Siria can
fulfil the magician any wish in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 365: Vollman (11Â° Pisces) - This head will initiate the magician
into the most subtle mysteries of light. Following this head's
instructions, the magician will reach a degree of maturity which
will enable him to apply the mysteries of light in respect of magic,
quabbalah and alchemy, so that he will be able to achieve
anything in all three planes - the astral, mental and physical.
Apart from this, he will be set into a state of happiness which cannot
be described.
<br><br>Fig. 366: Hagomi (12Â° Pisces) - reveals to the magician quabbalistic
methods, regarding mental wandering and the elevation
into other spheres that lie outside our planetary system. In these
spheres the magician will acquire that kind of knowledge which a
person not initiated into magic could never comprehend. Hagomi
will teach the magician how to influence our zone girdling the
earth mentally, astrally and physically from other spheres in
which he has set his mental body.
<br><br>Fig. 367: Klorecha (13Â° Pisces) - This head helps people who are
eagerly longing to learn about the truth to acquire true occult
knowledge. This he does by making it possible for them either to
be directly taught by an initiate or by at least procuring for him
books for private study. Klorecha is a great friend of occult
philosophy.
<br><br>Fig. 368: Baroa (140 Pisces) - Like many other heads of the
zone girdling the earth, this one also is a friend and supporter of
any kind of arts. He supports everything beautiful and ideal, inspires
writers, journalists, editors, poets and other artists in their
work and helps them gain success in all their doings. If the magician
refers to this head, he can be sure of his help.
<br><br>Fig. 369: Gomognu (15Â° Pisces) - is the original initiator into
that kind of language that is expressed by gestures, moving of
hands, etc. The blind, too, are indebted to this head for their
faculty to read by braille, i. e. for having inspired them in this
respect. By his assistance the blind and dumb will be given better
means of communication as time goes on and technological conditions
improve. The magician can, if he wishes, look into the
future and see what is to be.
<br><br>Fig. 370: Fermetu (16Â° Pisces) - This head may justly be called
the great creator of peace, since all matters which have to do with
peace come under his competence, no matter whether whole nations
are involved or whether peace in the family, peace in marriage,
is concerned. Fermatu procures for the magician fortunate
love, helps him to make friends and eternalises any kind of sympathy
between man and woman.
<br><br>Fig. 371: Forsteton (17Â° Pisces) - Childless, infertile female magicians
are given advice by this head on how to become fertile. He
shows them means and ways by which they can determine in advance
the sex of the baby they expect. If asked to do so, Forsteton
will remove from man or woman frigidity and increase their sexual
powers. The methods revealed by this head will enable the
magician to maintain the sexual and intellectual powers of youth
until he is a very old man. A magician whose sexual powers
decline, but who, for some reason or other, wants to increase
them will not only find an excellent adviser in Forsteton, but also
a ready assistant.
<br><br>Fig. 372: Lotogi (18Â° Pisces) - knows he secret methods for the
manufacturing of most effective amulets and talismans to serve
love, marriage and friendship. This head is quite willing to unveil
his secret knowledge to the magician and even to charge the
amulets and talismans for the magician. Since the range of competence
of this head is very large, many other advantages will
result for the magician, should he get into contact with him. For
instance, he can learn how to get into contact with beings of the
Venus sphere in a simple way; not only with the beings of that
sphere, but also with human beings that live there. Once, I was
accompanied by this head in the mental body when visiting the
planet called Venus and was able to watch the life and doings of
the Venusians, who have a light-silvery skin and are much more
advanced in their spiritual development than man on earth: they
are far more advanced in technology than we are. Due to their
technical achievements they are able to leave their planet without
effort and visit other planets without hindrance, contrary to man
on earth, who has not yet been able to proceed far beyond the
stratosphere. In size Venusians are somewhat shorter than we.
However, on other planets, for instance on Saturn, there are
human beings of the size of giants, so that, taking our
measurements, one would have to take a ladder at least 30 feet
high in order to get on top of the big toe of a Saturnian. Should a
magician want to visit such a planet in order to get into contact
with the human beings living there, he would have to expand his
mental body in such a manner that he reaches the size of a Saturnian.
The method to be applied for the expansion of the mental
body has already been described in "Initiation into Hermetics".
<br><br>Fig. 373: Nearah (19Â° Pisces) - is an excellent inspirer of
chemical, especially pharmaceutical, inventions. Depending on
his degree of maturity he allows this or that innovation in pharmacy
to become known through a suitable person. However, this
head has a predilection for dental medicine and dental surgery
and, under the seal of secrecy, he allows the magician a glimpse
into his range of competence in the Akasha-principle, how far
pharmacy science and dentistry will advance in the future. I was,
for example, allowed to look into the future to see the changes in
respect of pharmacy and dentistry: not only will man then be able
to make artificial teeth from resistant materials, but new fantastic
inventions will make it possible to grow natural teeth in adults.
As soon as mankind has reached a certain degree of maturity,
Nearah will inspire suitable persons with the secret of making
bad teeth fall out by themselves, without the necessity of a painful
extraction, due to the application of certain pharmaceutical
substances. After this the person concerned will grow new,
healthy teeth within a very short time. Man will thus become
master over the growth of his teeth. The same will then be the
case with man's hair. Hair getting grey or falling out will then be
something belonging to the past. Each person will be able to
choose the colour for his hair which he likes, without having to
apply any hair dye. Though all this might sound like a fairy tale
and bring doubts to the sceptical reader, it is the pure truth that
will be proved by the future. But a magician who is able to proceed
beyond time and space often prefers to keep silence in order
not to become the object of scorn from immature persons.
<br><br>Fig. 374: Dagio (20Â° Pisces) - It is the task of this intelligence to
see that man develops intellectually. If the magician follows the
methods willingly offered him by Dagio he will get a fantastic
memory, will quickly become an intelligent being, mastering all
situations in a verbal argument, and, above that, will prove suprisingly
witty in all situations of life.
<br><br>Fig. 375: Nephasser (21Â° Pisces) - Being a great messenger of fortune,
this head, like many other intelligences of the zone girdling
the earth, procure happiness, riches, material success and satisfaction
for the magician. Nephasser also has at his disposal great
treasures of spiritual knowledge, and the magician will get from
him the kind of treasures that he asks for. '
<br><br>Fig. 376: Armefia (22Â° Pisces) - A magician will seldom ask this
head to help and assist him personally. However, in case he wants
to help immature, magically untrained people, this head will certainly
not refuse his assistance. Armefia can secure the protection
of very important people, causes a just sentence if somebody is
summoned to court innocently, lets the judge apply the most extreme
leniency in case of a person being guilty and protects all
those people who are exposed to great dangers.
<br><br>Fig. 377: Kaerlesa (23Â° Pisces) - Being master of the natural
science, this head makes the magician understand thoroughly the
laws of nature, especially the higher laws in all three kingdoms:
the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdom. He allows the magician
to penetrate deep into these laws and teaches him their
magical application. The magician who is a friend of nature or
even an explorer of nature will find that this head can be of great
value to him in many respects.
<br><br>Fig. 378: Bileka (24Â° Pisces) - initiates the magician into the
various types of meditation and teaches him their correct application
for magical quabbalistic purposes. Due to the instructions
received from Bileka the magician, precisely following them,
will develop such faculties which are almost unintelligible and
which would strike any other person as incredible. But to be able
to get into contact with this head, a certain degree of magical
maturity is needed. The first evocation usually results in the appearance
of this head's subordinates who tell the magician what
preparations are necessary in order to get into good direct contact
with Bileka. Although well informed about the way one has to
approach Bileka I am not allowed to reveal this, and any other
magician, too, will keep this a secret, for there exist mysteries that
are never allowed to be published.
<br><br>Fig. 379: Ugolog (25Â° Pisces) - The methods which this head of
the zone girdling the earth has at his disposal are known to only a
few initiates on this earth. The magician who learns about them
from Ugolog is offered the possibility of acquiring the faculty
which enables him to read any man's Karma in the mental, astral
and physical world directly and clearly out of the Akashaprinciple.
The magician applying this head's methods will learn
to read the past, present and future thoughts of any human being,
his astral development from its origin to its perfect maturity as
well as the physical fate of past or future incarnations. Ugolog's
methods turn the magician into a famous prophet, that type of
prophet that only occurs once in a while in history. In the olden
times these methods were only revealed by the high priests to the
most mature neophytes.
<br><br>Fig. 380: Tmiti (26Â° Pisces) - This head is the custodian of secret
methods and he only reveals them no mature magicians. These
methods enable one to draw down from planets and spheres
planetary powers in a magical quabbalistic manner and to use
them for special magical operations in the three planes; the mental,
astral and physical, in the zone girdling the earth as well as in
our material world. The effects brought about by the application
of such powers are of such an enormous range that a non-initiate
would only think them possible in a dream.
<br><br>Fig. 381: Zalones (27Â° Pisces) - The magician is taught by this
head all the mysteries of the microcosm and the macrocosm and
he is also shown the way to acquire perfect divine cognition
without having to choose the path of holiness and losing his
magical individuality. Magicians following the instructions given
by this intelligence will then be given by Divine Providence certain
missions and tasks which they have to carry out in the zone
girdling the earth, or even on our earth, and which make them
teachers or assistants of mankind by the force of magic and the
quabbalah, without the people concerned realizing the true
authority of such great ones.
<br><br>Fig. 382: Cigila (28Â° Pisces) - Since this head is a special initiator
into, and a teacher of, magical quabbalistic mysticism, he can
make the magician acquainted with secret methods which enable
the latter to develop within himself in all three planes - the mental,
the astral and the physical - most perfect divine virtues by
the help of magic and quabbalah. Having developed within
himself these virtues, the magician will then find it easy to acquire
all those faculties which are connected to these virtues. The magician
following these secret methods becomes more and more
mature in fulfilling carefully certain tasks according to the will of
Divine Providence. However, Cigila only reveals these secret
methods to the magician who has already reached a certain degree
of maturity in magic and quabbalah during previous incarnations.
A magician developed due to these methods in a god-like creature,
a personified deity, equipped with all the virtues, powers and
faculties, equal to Divine Providence.
<br><br>Fig. 383: Ylemis (29Â° Pisces) - reveals to the mature magician
the most secret mysteries of the love divine and makes him realize
its range of power in the mental, astral and physical plane from
the magical quabbalistic point of view. The realization of this
divine love must naturally create within the magician a feeling of
happiness which brings him up to the highest grades of ecstasy.
<br><br>Fig. 384: Boria (30Â° Pisces) - From this last head of the zone
girdling the earth the magician can get thorough information on
the correlative effects of elements and fluids in the whole microcosm
and macrocosm, i. e. in all spheres and on all planets of the
zone girdling the earth in all three planes - mental, astral and
physical, and he can also get exact information on the magical application
of these effects. If asked by the magician, this head can
also inform him of the chemical compounds and original
substances that exist on other planets, as well as of their effects
and influence, i. e. of facts that are completely unknown on our
earth. Boria also teaches him their useful application not only for
magical and quabbalistic purposes, but also in technology and
chemistry. Guided by Boria, the magician becomes an omniscient
and omnipotent person in respect of the microcosm as well as
the macrocosm and he cannot be governed by any other being
but the One Unpersonified Divine Providence.
<br>*
<br>This brings us to the end of the description of the 360 heads of
the zone girdling the earth. Every magician will agree that their
real existance is no doubt only known to a few, i. e. to the high initiates
of this earth. The size of this volume makes it impossible
for me to give full details on each individual head; I can only
publish a few words refering to the general facts of hermetic
science. If everything were mentioned that falls under the competence
of each individual head, i. e. the work and duties in the
zone girdling the earth with respect to the Akasha-principle, the
elements, the cause and effect of legality, the laws of analogy,
polarity, electromagnetic fluid, etc., more than a whole book
with hundreds of pages would have to be written on just one
single head. The description of many a head whose range of competence
is very great would fill not just one volume, but a good
number of volumes.
<br><br>However, this brief information on the intelligences will be sufficient
to provide the mature magician with the necessary guides,
for this is the true purpose of the descriptions. If the magician
wants to get into contact with a certain intelligence, he will find a
great number of possibilities to do so.
<br><br>It will surely have attracted attention to the magician that many
heads have similar, or even the same ranges of competence. This
assumption becomes even more apparent due to the fact that I
have dealt with the responsibities of the heads from the hermetic
point of view, as already mentioned. The magician will certainly
find this agreeable, for it gives him more possibilities to choose
from. Later he might realize that though there is a certain
similarity in the ranges of competence, the methods, instructions
and operating principles of each head are completely different.
<br><br>This means that the magician can have his wishes turned into
reality in various ways and by completely different means and
that he is not just dependant on one method or instruction given
by just one head. This is also the reason why it is impossible to
publish here all the instructions that could be given the magician
for the realization of his wishes, irrespective of the fact that many
heads insist on their methods remaining secret. Thus though the
zone girdling the earth is something quite new, so far quite
unknown to the magician, it is of very great importance. Up to
now there has been no writer of astrology or quabbalah, who
would have been able to say anything about the existence of the
zone girdling the earth. The astrologer who is at the same time a
trained magician will be able to enlarge his knowledge by studying
the information given in this volume on the existence of the
zone girdling the earth. When finding out about certain influences,
he will not only be able to employ his knowledge of the
zodiac and the planets - which are an astrological commonplace
- for his calculations, but he will also be able to take into account
the influence of the zone girdling the earth, on the fates of men.
From the astrological point of view the zone girdling the earth
can be regarded as the ecliptic of our earth divided into 360
degrees. Going by our measure of time each head's influence on
each place of our earth lasts four minutes, the first head's influence
starting at sunrise and returning next sunrise. If, for instance,
the astrologer knows the exact minute of a man's birth, it
is easy for him to work out which head's sympathy that man can
rely. The talents becoming effective in a man can also be assessed
by him when taking into account the influence of the zone girdling
the earth. If, in consequence, the astrologer also takes into
consideration the stellar constellations when working out the
horoscope, he will obtain striking results. And if he does not only
look at the horoscope from the mantic point of view, but also
adds to it all favourable planetary constellations which can be
assessed for a certain degree of the ecliptic, he will be able to
throw a deep glance into synthetic astrology and enlarge his
knowledge in a manner which otherwise, by the mere application
of the usual astrological facts, would never be possible.
<br><br>Such an astrologer will, for instance, work out the influence of
the cosmic elements of the spheres on our physical world in quite
a different way and regard it from quite a different point of view
than he would have done before. Doing this, he will get much
nearer to the actual truth than it was the case up to now. A
thick volume could be written on synthetic astrology and its
relations to the whole hermetic science including the facts of the
zone girdling the earth, which I intend to do at a later
date, providing the impulse comes from Divine Providence.
The astrologically trained magician may therefore find it expedient
to work out the exact period of influence of the intelligence
or head of the zone girdling the earth whom he wants to evoke
for the first time, starting to count from sunrise. This will,
facilitate his work. The well trained magician will, of course, not
regard it necessary to stick to the assessed time to carry out his
evocations.
<br><br>Along with the positive heads of the zone girdling the earth the
opposed intelligences also, which are the representatives of the
negative principle in their range of power, become effective. I
have deliberately omitted to give any description of the negative
heads, their names or seals, in order to hold back the magician
from any disadvantageous experiments.
<br><br>A magician will want to get into contact only with those heads
that coincide with his own ideals. For if he wished to explore
the whole zone girdling the earth with all its heads and other beings
one incarnation would not be enough, even if he were to live
a hundred years. Already when looking at it from the theoretical
point of view, the magician will be convinced that the heads are
able to reveal to him the highest kind of wisdom, provide him
with the most comprehensive knowledge, put at his disposal the
highest powers, open the gates and pave the way to the greatest
magical faculties. Then there is nothing on earth that the magician
is not able to achieve, for he has all the keys to wisdom,
power and authority. He is then capable of fulfilling any wish.
<br><br><strong>4. The Intelligences of the Moon Sphere<A name=moon></A></strong>
<br><br>When the magician has become sufficiently acquainted with the
zone girdling the earth, so that he has contacts with some of its
heads, especially the masters of magic, he may start trying to get
into contact with intelligences of the Moon sphere, by mental
travelling or by carefully arranged evocations, either in our
physical world or in the zone girdling the eanh, or even directly
in the Moon sphere. At that point he must have got sufficient information
from one of the many heads of the zone girdling the
eanh, i. e. he must have undergone a certain training in order to
be able to control the Moon sphere.
<br><br>The first journeys to the Moon sphere the magician best carries
out in the company of a head of the zone girdling the eanh, providing
he has, above all, faultless control over his elavation into
other spheres. A personal guide, a Guru, can also introduce the
magician into the Moon sphere by following him by thoughts
durings his mental wandering or evocational operations right into
the Moon sphere. A well trained magician who has carefully
followed my instructions given in the first volume "Initiation into
Hermetics" may also betake himself safely into the Moon
sphere without a guide and without any special assistance. After a
certain time he will get used to the oscillations of the Moon
sphere, which are rather different from those of the zone girdling
the eanh, the physical world and the kingdom of elements. As
soon as the magician has overcome the first difficulties, he will
feel at home, just as he does in any other sphere.
<br><br>The moon, being the earth's nearest neighbour and its satelite,
is completely dependent on it. During his mental wandering the
magician will find it proved that there exists on the moon no living
being and that there is no vegetation whatsoever and
therefore also no human beings. The moon - similar to the eanh
- is sorrounded by a sphere which initiates call the Moon sphere.
This sphere is inhabited by innumerable beings, much like the
zone girdling the eanh. To give a full account of all the beings of
the Moon sphere, would fill innumerable pages and is therefore
not possible from the technical point of view. The initiates of the
Moon sphere, like the initiates of the zone girdling the earth,
have been commissioned by Divine Providence to carry out
various tasks; they are equipped with special faculties and powers
and are able to bring about certain causes, and with them naturally
also certain effects, directly in the Moon sphere as well as on
our eanh. Operating from the Moon sphere, some intelligences
have to carry out certain duties also on other planets and their
spheres. Already certain heads of the zone girdling the earth are
able to inform the magician of the magic of the moon. It need not
be especially stressed in this connection that the moon by its turn
and circulation round our earth ball quickly passes through the
various electromagnetic fields of force and oscillations of its own
aura and of the aura of our earth, practically directly cutting
through them, and, by doing so, influencing the existence and
fate of the earth planet.
<br><br>The sphere magician is able to work out the moon's influence
on the four grades of the ecliptic i. e. of the zone girdling the
earth, and due to his knowledge of the laws of analogy, also its influence
on the zone girdling the earth itself and on our physical
world. It is up to the experienced magician to make use of his
knowledge of these influences. Sphere-magic, therefore, is
nothing fantastic, but a secret knowledge which is only equalled
by the knowledge of the quabbalah.
<br><br>Below, the reader will find a short description of the 28 heads of
the Moon sphere that have an outstanding influence on the zone
girdling the earth, as well as on our material world, i. e. on all the
three planes of human existence. Often these intelligences are
regarded as the rulers of the 28 Moon stations known to the quabbalistic
astrologer in their good as well as in their bad function.
<br><br>This means that there are actually 28 positive and 28 negative
heads of the Moon sphere. The former have the task of creating
good causes and effects, the latter of creating the contrary. To prevent
the reader from any misuse, only a description of the 28
positive heads of the Moon sphere is given here. If the magician is
desirous of getting temporarily into contact with the negative
heads, he can do so without having to fear any bad influence on
body and soul. Only few initiates are informed about the names
and seals of the heads of the Moon sphere. The facts stated here
are based on frequent personal intercourse with all kinds of beings
and heads of all the spheres, including, of course, those of the
Moon sphere.
<br><br>Fig. 1: Ebvap - is the name of the first head of the Moon
sphere. It is his commission to control the regularity of the tide.
He is an excellent initiator into the electric and magnetic fluids
and their use in moon magic. If the magician carefully follows the
explanations of this head and does as he is told, he is able to produce
phenomena in the zone girdling the earth as well as in our
physical world, on all three planes, the mental, astral and physical
that are nothing short of miracles, by means of the magnetic influences
of the moon and the electric fluid of the earth. Besides
this, Ebvap and his subordinates protect the magician against any
unfavourable influences which he might have to encounter during
his work with the influences of the moon. The first head of
the moon sphere can, furthermore, unveil to the magician a great
number of mysteries that until now may have remained hidden
to him.
<br><br>Fig. 2: Emtircheyud - is the second head of the Moon sphere.
He is responsible for controlling the rhythm in our physical
world. This rhythm is produced by suitable intelligences of the
zone girdling the earth in the world of causes at the will of this
head. He teaches the magician the laws of bio-rhythm and
periodicity of our earth and their use for mantic and magical purposes.
The magician learns that the nine months of a woman's
pregnancy have a special relation to the quabbalistic number nine,
the number of the moon. Furthermore, the magician will get
from this head exact details of the analogy of a woman's
menstruation to the moon, of periodicity, of polarity and of
many other relevant things.
<br><br>Fig. 3: Ezhesekis - This head, the third of the Moon sphere,
shows the magician how, by the correlative influences of the
moon sphere, he can procure for himself, in the Akasha-principle,
happiness and everything good. Since this head's influence
usually works on the physical world, he and his subordinates will
help the magician to good luck and success in all earthly matters.
<br><br>Fig. 4: Emvatibe - the fourth head of the Moon sphere, protects
the magician against all underhand tricks and acts of revenge by
hostile men. He or his subordinates, which he likes to put at the
magician's disposal as familiar spirits will reveal to the magician
any secret plans of his enemies, any intended acts of revenge or
malice, prior to their being carried out and will advise the magician
on how to protect himself against malicious people. Emvatibe's
serving spirits are able to defeat any acts of revenge planned
by hostile men at the very moment of their origin. This head
of the moon sphere reveals to the magician with a certain degree
of maturity words and formulae for banning which enable the magician
to paralize or even kill a person, or whole groups of persons,
at the moment of their utterance. The magician can bring about
such effects over the greatest distances. The person concerned will
die at once from a heart attack. Of course, also temporary or lifelong
paralysis can be effected by such words or formulae. They
will, however, only be revealed to magician who would never
think of misusing them.
<br><br>Fig. 5: Amzhere - is the fifth head of the Moon sphere, who
apart from other things, can procure for the magician the favour,
of and protection by, very important personalities. By using simple
quabbalistic methods, revealed to the magician by Amzhere,
the former can make the heart of the hardest man melt, can make
his greatest enemy his friend at once and is able to raise sympathy
and love in any human being he is interested in. The magician is
capable of making pliant any person he wishes.
<br><br>Fig. 6: Enchede - the sixth head of the Moon sphere, is able to
create love in untrained people, in a man for a certain woman
and, vice versa, in a woman for a certain man. To the trained
magician, however, will be explained by Enchede the mysteries of
sexual magic in its relation to moon magic. Apart from that, the
latter will teach the magician the charging of all kinds of
talismans and amulets provided with fluid condensers, with influences
of the moon, by force of sexual magic. This may be done
for diverse purposes specifically for creating love, sympathy,
power of attraction, popularity, etc.
<br><br>Fig. 7: Emrudue - If a person not initiated into magic wears the
seal of the seventh head of the Moon sphere, manufactured during
the astrological period of the seventh moon station and
engraved on a silver plate, he or she will have good luck and success,
and,above all, have any earthly desire fulfilled. The trained
magician, having got into contact with this head, will be taught
how to realize all his wishes by force of moon magic, no matter
whether they concern the mental, astral or physical world.
Emrudue brings the magician good luck and success and likes to
put his subordinates as familiar spirits at the latter's disposal.
<br><br>Fig. 8: Eneye - the eighth head of the Moon sphere is a con -
noiseur of all diplomatic and political events. He can be of great
use to the magician by helping him to make a political career and
to be successful in all diplomatic affairs. Since this head, above all,
is a lover of peace, he assists, in the time of war, such people who
follow the high ideals of peace, truth and justice. The magician being
active in this line is able to win any fight, any war, no matter
how it is to be carried out.
<br><br>Fig. 9: Emzhebyp - the ninth head of the Moon sphere, is the
special guardian angel of sick people whose ailment is due to unfavourable
influences of the moon or to the doings of negative
spirits of the moon sphere. This is usually the case with epileptic
fits, menstruation difficulties, states of obsession, hysteria, St.
Vitus's Dance, lunacy, etc. This head reveals to the magician how
to cure such diseases by force of moon magic.
<br><br>Fig. 10: Emnymar - is the name of the tenth head of the Moon
sphere. He is responsible for controlling the pregnancy period
and birth of man. Together with the relevant head of the zone
girdling the earth he lets man see the light of day. Therefore all
gynaecologists, midwives and their assistants are under his influence.
Emnymar teaches the magician how to effect a painless
delivery in those cases where he considers it necessary and informs
the magician in advance whether the baby in the mother's
womb is going to be a boy or a girl. He can also come to know
from this head the exact time at which sexual intercourse should
take place in order to procreate a baby of that sex which its
parents have in mind. Emnymar is the protector of all mesmerists
and the people that deal with mesmerism. He shows the magician
diverse methods for the treatment of diseases by the magnetic
fluid. He knows means for completely curing venereal diseases.
<br><br>Fig. 11: Ebvep - The eleventh head of the Moon sphere makes
it possible for the magician to gain, by magical methods, the
respect of people, no matter of what rank they may be. Besides
that, he teaches the magician to bring about phenomena which
would make a non-initiate tremble with dread and horror.
Although it is not easy to get into direct contact with this head, the
magician who has reached a good degree of magical development
will succeed in it, if necessary, under the guidance of a head of the
zone girdling the earth, or of his own Guru. The magician will
then be able to convince himself that this head is an excellent initiator
into phenomenal moon magic.
<br><br>Fig. 12: Emkebpe - is the name of the twelfth head of the Moon
sphere, who is a great lover of peace and happiness in marriage
and wherever good luck, love and sympathy are involved. He
makes the magician aware of the transmuting power of real love.
Emkebpe reveals to the magician the relevant methods for the
production of love-amulets which can be charged by moon
magic.
<br><br>Fig. 13: Emcheba - the thirteenth head of the Moon sphere, is
an excellent initiator into mummial magic as far it is connected
with the influences of the moon. The magician, therefore, is
taught by this head the relations between mummial magic and
moon magic, its successful application as well as how to make use
of the magnetic influence of the moon. This head will inform the
magician of many magical practices, such as for instance, in what
harmless way he can enter into astro-magical pacts by force of
mummial magic, without the magician having to renounce
himself literarily with "body and soul". The astro-magical pacts
are then carried through with a mummy, the magician thereby
being able to bring about the most diverse effects by the help of a
fluid condenser, without ever getting involved into the matter
himself, i.e. without leaving any disadvantageous traces for his
own person in the world of causes, in the Akasha. Since this head
has control over some more secrets in this direction a magician is
well advised not to omit him.
<br><br>Fig. 14: Ezhobar - the fourteenth head of the Moon sphere, can
be of great value to the magician inasmuch as he can reveal to him
the secrets of creating within himself, without difficulties, the
most diverse occult and magical faculties by the help of moon
magic, which later may possibly be also applied in the other
spheres. The magician is, at the same time, taught the polarization
of powers; furthermore, how to bring about, in a certain way, the
levitation of himself and of other people, or even of other objects,
by force of quabbalistic moon magic, by change of polarity of
gravity. The magician also learns how to acquire the faculty of interpreting
symbols that he sees in the Moon sphere by force of
clairvoyance, Ezhobar teaches the magician to comprehend the
laws of the Moon sphere from the magical quabbalistic point of
view and how to control them practically. Ezhobar is therefore
rightly called a marvelous initiator into quabbalistic moon-magic.
<br><br>Fig. 15: Emnepe - No magician being in contact with intelligences
of the Moon sphere will fail to get into contact with
this head, the fifteenth in the correct order, for he can be initiated
by him into many things that up to now have remained
unknown to him. The magician will, for instance, be informed
about the influence of divine virtues on beings of the Moon
sphere and how the Akasha-principle works directly on the
Moon-sphere and from there on the zone girdling the earth.
Emnepe will be pleased to tell the magician about methods by
which he can acquire the faculty of reading in the Akashaprinciple,
with his mental body placed into the Moon sphere and
how to bring about magical effects there. It is impossible to give
all details and advantages which the magician will be offered
when getting into contact with this head. Therefore any magician
should see that his contact with Emnepe becomes realized.
<br><br>Fig. 16: Echotasa - The magician is taught by the sexteenth
head of the Moon sphere how to get control over the negative beings
of that sphere, either by way of mental wandering or by way
of evocation, and how to make them pay him absolute obedience.
At the same time he introduces the magician to diverse magical
measures of protection, which not only make him invulnerable
against any unfavourable influences, but which also help him to
become a magic authority, respected not only by the positive but
also by the negative beings. By character this head of the Moon
sphere is a very benevolent intelligence, who will be pleased to
give the mature magician any kind of assistance and who
therefore will also, unveil to him the secrets of moon magic.
<br><br>Fig. 17: Emzhom - One of the peculiarities of moon magic is
the so-called magic banning. Under the seal of secrecy the seventeenth
head of the Moon sphere, Emzhom can give the mature
magician exact information on this. He will reveal to the latter
diverse quabbalistic and magic formulae, banning formulae,
which can be used for a great variety of purposes. For instance,
Emzhom knows banning formulae by which any enemy can be
destroyed at once, or such formulae by which thieves are checked
on their escape, so that they cannot make any further step with
the stolen goods in hand, no matter where they are; banning formulae
that make any attacker stiff and lifeless at an instant; banning
formulae that at once put away any negative influence; banning
formulae that render harmless the most furious beast, no matter
whether in the air, on land or in the water. This head disposes
of many other kinds of banning formulae. Of course, the magician
to whom these banning formulae have been revealed will only
make use of them in case of greatest danger. Emzhom is an intelligence
much respected in the Moon sphere. All moon beings
look up to him in awe.
<br><br>Fig. 18: Emzhit - The eighteenth head of the Moon sphere informs
the magician of secret methods which enable him to
become invisible by the help of moon magic, moon-quabbalah,
moon beings and the Akasha-principle. Apart from that, Emzhit
informs the magician of the laws of materialization and dematerialization,
not only in respect to the astral body, but also in
respect of physical matter. This head is rightly regarded as the initiator
into magical transmutation.
<br><br>Fig. 19: Ezheme - is the name of the nineteenth head of the
Moon sphere. Being an original initiator, this head explains clearly
to the magician any influence of the legality and analogy of the
moon and the Moon sphere in their relations to the zone girdling
the earth and our physical world in all three planes, the mental,
astral and physical, and he teaches the magician how to make
practical use of his newly gained knowledge in the magical and
quabbalistic sense. The magician can gain more knowledge and
wisdom from this head than he might think possible.
<br><br>Fig. 20: Etsacheye - The twentieth head of the Moon sphere is
an excellent master of initiation, especially as far as that of ecstasy
is concerned, which is brought about by magical dances and ap-
propriate rituals in connection with moon-magic and moonquabbalah.
Only few initiates know that special powers and
faculties are released by ecstatic dances and rituals. The magician
will be told about this by this head. Furthermore, the magician
will learn from Etsacheye how to get under his control all the influences
of the Moon sphere and how to win the supremacy over
the positive as well as the negative beings of the moon. It stands
to reason that by doing so the magician will become an authority
on the Moon sphere.
<br><br>Fig. 21: Etamrezh - The twenty-first head of the Moon sphere
instructs the magician how, by certain magic and quabbalistic
methods, to become strong and resistant against any visible and
invisible enemies, against any kind of influence by elements, etc.
He becomes magically taboo. No man on earth is able to assail or
do harm to a magician who enjoys - and works under - the protection
and guidance of this head of the Moon sphere. The magician
is safe from any persecution or magical assault. He is capable
of enduring the greatest possible heat, of going through the
greatest fire, without a single hair of his head being burned. By
following special methods revealed to him by this head the magician
can make his body as hard as a diamond. He is invulnerable
from the magical point of view and master over his life and death.
<br><br>Fig. 22: Rivatim - The magician is taught by the twenty second
head of the Moon sphere to consciously absorb the facts of time
and space in the Moon sphere. He is then able able to transfer
over the greatest distances not only his mental, but also his astral,
if necessary, even his physical body. The magician guided by this
head of the Moon sphere can confidently walk along the surface
of the sea without sinking into the water, can rise into the air and
travel through it as he likes, can, in short, bridge any distance
with spirit, soul and body. Time and space become unimportant
to the magician not only in spirit, but also with regards to his
astral and physical body, and matter is in no way a hindrance to
him.
<br><br>Fig. 23: Liteviche - The magician who has gained the confidence
of the twenty-third head of the Moon sphere will be initiated
by him into the remotest secrets of magic and quabbalah
and is allowed to command powerful words by which he is able
to calm down instantly the greatest gales at sea, check the most
horrifying eruptions of vulcanos, to kill whole armies, to win
wars, etc. The magician with high ethical standards will, of
course, never dare to misuse the words of power that he has been
taught, for by doing so he would oppose legality and only do
harm to himself. Guided by this head the magician will get such
powerful influence, not only on the Moon sphere, but also on the
zone girdling the earth and on our physical world, that a noninitiate
cannot have the faintest notion of it.
<br><br>Fig. 24: Zhevekiyev - is the name of the twenty-fourth head of
the Moon sphere, who is rightly called the alchemist of that
sphere. He initiates the magician into the working of the
elements on the moon. The magician is taught by Zhevekiyev
suitable methods for the alchemical transformation of metals by
being able to control the electromagnetic fluids; he, furthermore,
reveals to him the secrets of true magical rejuvenation of the
physical and the astral body and explains to him the laws of life
and death valid in the Moon sphere, thereby also considering the
zone girdling the earth and our physical world. By the connection
with this head special advantages are offered to the magician.
<br><br>Fig. 25: Lavemezhu - To influence and control the plant
kingdom is the task of the twenty-fifth head of the Moon sphere.
He reveals to the magician all the mysteries of life, of sprouting
and growing, and shows him how to master this kingdom by
moon magic. The magician is then able to accelerate, or to stop
growth at will. Following the instructions given by this head the
magician is able, by the help of moon magic and by applying certain
quabbalistic words, to make fertile in a supernatural way a
whole field, no matter how large it may be, or, vice versa, to
make it infertile and change it into a desert.
<br><br>Fig. 26: Empebyn - It is the special commission of the twentysixth
head of the Moon sphere to explain to the magician who has
got into contact with him the causes and effects of the sun and its
light in its mental, astral and physical relation to the moon and
the Moon sphere, furthermore, the effects of these influences on
the zone girdling the earth as well as on our physical world, its
mineral, vegetable and animal kingdom. Empebyn also informs
the magician of the influences that the sun light has on the moon
and from there on our human bodies, in the mental, astral and
physical respect, and teaches him the practical application of all
this knowledge.
<br><br>Fig. 27: Emzhabe - is the name of the twenty-seventh head of
the Moon sphere, who informs the magician of all the minerals of
earth having an analoges connection with the moon and its
sphere. Since Emzhabe is a marvelous initiator into moon magic,
the connection with him can be of great advantage to the magi-
cian.
<br><br>Fig. 28: Emzher - is the name of the twenty-eighth and last
head of the Moon sphere. The magician is instructed by him how
to get under his complete control the element of water in the
Moon sphere and in our physical world, using moon magic and
quabbalah to achieve this. Not only will he thus get under his
power all animals that live in the water, but he will, at the same
time, become the master of temperature. The magician operating
according to the instructions of this head may be sprinkled with
boiling water, but will not get any scalds. Protected by Emzher, a
magician can bring about such miraculous things as changing
boiling water into ice.
<br>*
<br>This brings us to the end of the description of the 28 heads of
the Moon sphere. For the purpose of their first evocation their
seals have to be drawn in a white or silvery colour. Every magician
who has already become master of the zone girdling the
earth should not omit to strive for and realize contacts with at
least a few heads of the Moon sphere, for it will only turn out to
his great advantage, never to his disadvantage.
<br><br><strong>5. The 72 Intelligences of the Mercury Zone<A name=mercury></A></strong>
<br><br>The next sphere which the magician is to explore and to control
is the Mercury sphere. In order to be able to stand its vibrations
the magician must have learned to control the influences and the
vibrations of the sphere previously dealt with, i. e. the Moon
sphere. The description of the individual genii of this zone is accompanied
by a number of hints which will, no doubt, be of interest
to the magician.
<br><br>Hermes Trismegistos, an Egyptian high priest, was, no doubt,
one of the greatest initiates before Christ. In his book of wisdom
known under the title of "Thoth" he has left to posterity the
highest wisdom that can ever be grasped on our planet. His tabula
smaragdina - Hermestablet - serves to prove the macrocosmic
and microcosmic laws of analogy. This wisdom is called
Hermetic science by people having reached the necessary maturity
for their initiation. Originally the Book of Wisdom by this
high initiate consisted of 78 plates which later became generally
known as the 78 tarot cards. Although these tarot cards were
degraded in the course of the time and used in card games, their
secret meaning up to this day remains known to a few elect.
The meditating magician will find a certain connection between
the 78 tarot cards and the 72 genii of the Mercury zone and he
will attribute, out of the six remaining cards, four to the elements
and two to polarity. The first tarot card symbolises the spiritual
development of man. In my first work, entitled "Initiation into
Hermetics", this development is explained in a precisely worked
out system. The second tarot card symbolizes the connections
with the beings of all spheres. The practical way to bring about
such connections is explained in this book. The third tarot card
hints at the cosmic language, at quabbalah, which will be dealt
with in detail in my third work "The Key to the True Quabbalah".
According to the recordings left to posterity, Hermes
Trismegistos was a representative of the highest knowledge, a
brilliant example of human intelligence and of an enlightened
spirit in analogy to the Mercury sphere, for that sphere is assigned
to the immortal spirit and is analogous to it.
<br><br>Though the 72 genii of the Mercury sphere correspond in
number to the original number of tarot cards, they are not successively
represented by the tarot cards, i. e. by one tarot card for
each individual genius, but are all symbolized in a certain part of
the second tarot card, for this card, as already mentioned before,
represents the total spheric magic. Behind the numerical connection
between the 72 genii and the 78 tarot cards there is hidden a
secret quabbalistic key of the Mercury sphere.
<br><br>Many quabbalistic writers erroneously regard the 72 genii of
the Mercury sphere as the Schemhamphorash, i. e. the
unspeakable name of God consisting of 72 letters. But the socalled
Schemhamphorash, the unspeakable name of God, is
expressed by the four syllabic letters YOD-HE-VAU-HE the socalled
Tetragrammaton, or Adonai.
<br><br>The genuine initiate and quabbalist, however, is fully aware of
the fact that the names supplied with numbers are the numerical
key to the methods and instructions, the numerical key to correct
application. More details on this subject will be found in "The
Key to the True Quabbalah", which deals with quabbalistic
mysticism, magic of formulae, i. e. practical theurgy.
<br><br>The following survey of the cosmic orderliness including the
Mercury zone and its spheres is to make the magician acquainted
with the structure of our universe from the magic quabbalistic, i.
e. from the hermetic point of view.
<br><br>The Earth: The lowest sphere is our physical world with its three
kingdoms, the mineral, the vegetable and the animal kingdom.
The physical body of man is in analogous connection with these
three kingdoms.
<br><br>The Moon: In its planetary function the moon influences
eversthing liquid on our earth. The Moon sphere, however, is
analogous to the astral body and astral matrix of man. The "zone
girdling the earth" influences, on the other hand, the vital energy
of man.
<br><br>Mercury: As a planet, Mercury influences the gaseous state of
our earth. The mental body of man is subject to its sphere.
<br><br>Venus: As a planet it influences fertility on our earth, as far as
the vegetable and animal kingdoms are concerned. The Venus
sphere is connected with man's sympathy, love and fertilization.
<br><br>The Sun: This planet influences the physical life on our earth
in all three kingdoms. The Sun sphere maintains the life of the
mental, astral and physical body by the individual matrices.
<br><br>Mars: It influences all powers in the three kingdoms. As a
planet, it is mainly responsible for the urge for self-preservation
in the animal kingdom as well as in respect of man. The Mars
sphere raises within man the impulse and desire to live. It influences
man's character, qualities, total powers and faculties.
<br><br>Jupiter: As a planet, it causes harmony and legality. The Jupiter
sphere, on the other hand, controls the evolution of fate and
justice within man, leading him on his way to perfection, and
assisting him in his efforts to reach the Highest.
<br><br>Saturn: In its planetary function it influences the fates in all
three kingdoms, the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdom, of
our earth. In its subtlest form it is known amongst us as ether.
The Saturn sphere, on the other hand, controls the fate of man,
also called Karma. Man owes to the greatest influences of this
sphere his faculty for intuition by which, depending on the grade
of maturity of each individual, Divine Providence reveals itself.
In the non-initiate it manifests itself as conscience.
<br><br>Uranus: This planet is responsible for any kind of magical
development on our earth. Its sphere reveals to man all the
phenomena of magic.
<br><br>Neptune: In the hierarchy of the cosmos this planet keeps the
earth in its equilibrium. To the influence of this planet's sphere
man owes his knowledge of the way to perfection as well as his
knowledge of the cosmic language, of the so-called Quabbalah.
<br>*
<br>Beyond these spheres there is nothing else but the Divine Light,
the inconceivable and indiscribable, called Divine Providence by
us. There is nothing higher than that in our cosmic hierarchy.
In quabbalah, the cosmic hierarchy with all its influences is
called the Quabbalistic Tree of Life. Further details of this are to
be found in the author's third book "The Key to the True Quabbalah"
which is a description of the practical use of the quabbalah.
With reference to the Mercury zone it is pointed out once again
that its sphere is analogous to man's mental sphere and that the
genii of the Mercury sphere therefore greatly influence the spirit,
i. e. the mental body of every human being. If, however, a genius
of the Mercury sphere intended to affect, for instance, the astral
sphere of a human being, he would, according to the laws of
analogy, have to operate via the Moon sphere and the zone girdling
the earth in order to make his influence work. A magician
would have to do the same. The 72 genii of the Mercury zone are
mentioned in a number of quabbalistic books, but they are
described as independent genii irrespective of their belonging to a
special sphere. None of the authors of these books knew about
the true functions of the 72 genii of the Mercury zone, nor did
anyone of them ever contact them personally. The names of the
genii are correct, but the seals drawn and published in those
books are so deficient that it appears doubtful whether they were
ever based on true originals.
<br><br>Never satisfied with mere presumptions and always intending
to save other people's time for further explorations, I have personally
got into touch with all the 72 genii of the Mercury sphere
and bring here their true seals and give a short description of their
range of competence. The letters which accompany some seals
represent secret keys, as the magician, after having got into contact
with the relevant genius, will realize and learn. The seals of
these genii are usually drawn in a yellow colour on occasion of
their first evocation. One has, however, to take care that the signs
are reproduced in the same colours as in the pictured part of this
book. It does sometimes happen that a genius wants to have his
seal drawn in a different colour. The magician must by all means
see that he follows such a demand.
<br><br>Fig. 1: Vehuiah - is the name of the first genius of the Mercury
sphere. The magician will learn from this genius how to
strengthen his will-power and how to make his belief as firm as a
rock in order to be able, due to these faculties, to increase his
power of conviction in such a way that he can directly bring
about true miracles. The magician will be told by this genius the
secrecy of quickly achieving special kinds of magical faculties.
<br><br>Fig. 2: Jeliel - the second genius of the Mercury sphere, in-
itiates the magician into the mysteries of love and sympathy.
Since this genius also knows about all the secret mysteries of sexual
magic, he is prepared to reveal these to the mature magician.
The magician who is in touch with this genius will also be taught
how to change hostility into friendship, how to raise love in man
and woman by force of magic, how to make this love increase
and, should it be necessary, decay; how to become a master of
love; how to make thieves return their stolen goods; how to ban,
in various ways, murderers and other criminals; how to cause or
calm down an earthquake; how, by special methods, to understand
and be able to speak any language on earth; how to gain
respect, power and riches and, vice versa, how to make unworthy
people lose their reputation and riches. The contact with this
genius will bring the magician many advantages.
<br><br>Fig. 3: Sitael - the third genius, is an excellent expert in hypnosis,
suggestion and telepathy. By him the magician will be
taught the faculty of becoming perfect master of man and animal
by way of deception, dazzling, etc. Apart from this, he will be instructed
in the art of reading easily the past, present and future in
the Akasha-principle.
<br><br>Fig. 4: Elemiah - The fourth genius instructs the magician not
only how to become the master of his own fate, but also how to
control the fates of other people and of animals. Furthermore, the
magician learns how to charge magic words by quabbalistic
methods and to transfer them into the Akasha-principle in order
to bring about the desired effect in the mental, astral or physical
world, and how, by diverse methods of passive intercourse to get
into touch with the dead.
<br><br>Fig. 5: Mahasiah - The fifth genius teaches the magician to get
complete control over the elements by special quabbalistic
methods and to produce, without difficulty, all possible kinds of
phenomena, to treat successfully by magic and quabbalah incurable
diseases; to understand the laws of analogy of the
microcosm and the macrocosm and, by doing so, to penetrate
deeply into wisdom.
<br><br>Fig. 6: Lelahel - is the sixth genius of the Mercury sphere. As
an intiator into sexual mysteries he shows the magician how to effect
magical charges with the help of sexual magic. This genius is
especially fond of talismans and amulets charged by love magic
and he will make the magician acquainted with all aids serving
this purpose. He can give the magician exact information on all
fields of science known on earth. Apart from that, he can teach
him how to make, by a special process, diverse lucky charms and
talismans of protection. This genius is a friend of all artists, and, if
magician is an artist himself, he will be especially inspired by this
gemus.
<br><br>Fig. 7: Achaiah - The seventh genius instructs the magician in
the following: how to make a rapid career in magic by applying
apt methods, how to make enemies into friends, how to make
friends, how to raise love and how to read in the Akashaprinciple
the fate of individual persons as well as the fate of whole
nations.
<br><br>Fig. 8: Kahetel - is the name of the eighth genius of the Mercury
sphere. This genius teaches the magician to control the
electromagnetic fluid by the magic of elements, enabling him to
cause the most diverse phenomena in nature. The magician is also
taught by this genius how to influence, positively or negatively,
the growth of plants by the help of electromagnetic fluids. Having
learned from this genius certain powerful words, the magician
will be able to cause rain, snow, thunderstorm, hailstorm, etc.,
and make them cease again.
<br><br>Fig. 9: Aziel - The ninth genius teaches the magician Divine
Justice and Divine Mercy and shows him how far these two divine
virtues will go in all planes and spheres. Guided by this genius,
the magician will learn to appease enemies, to awaken love and to
make peace. The magician will then also know how to protect
himself by force of magic against his greatest enemies and their
assaults; he will have learnt how to become famous and rich. But
Aziel also informs the magician on everything that exists under
the surface of the earth, on hidden treasures, metals and subterranean
waters alike.
<br><br>Fig. 10: Aladiah - is the tenth genius. He teaches the magician
the occult anatomy of man, its harmonies and disharmonies and
shows him how to protect himself against inharmonious influences
in the quabbalistic manner and how to find the causes of
diseases and to treat them successfully. Aladiah is an excellent initiator
into chemistry and alchemy, into magic and quabbalah.
He instructs the magician in the use of powers and plants for
various magical practices.
<br><br>Fig. 11: Lauviah- the eleventh genius, makes a mature magician
acquainted with banning formulae by which he can influence
fierce thunderstorms, and fight and ban enemies. Being an initiator
Lauviah can instruct the magician in military science, can
teach him how to become a magical authority and how to
become a famous and honoured man. This genius will, furthermore,
help the magician to solve, with surprising easiness, the
most difficult problems.
<br><br>Fig. 12: Hahaiah - the twelfth genius, is an initiator into the
laws of analogy and teaches the language of symbols, i. e how to
interpret correctly all symbols, even the most complicated ones,
and, vice versa, how to express any idea by symbols. He makes
the magician solve the most difficult problems in hermetic
science, reveals to him deep truths and secret mysteries which up
to the present have only been comprehended by a few magicians.
This genius is also an excellent initiator into magic and quabbalah.
On account of his powers he is able to make the most embittered
enemies into friends, to make the love between friends
grow, and many ohter things.
<br><br>Fig. 13: Jezalel - The thirteenth genius helps all writers and artists
by inspiring them and making them thoroughly successful.
He shows the magician means and ways to become an excellent
orator. He assists politicians by awakening and increasing within
them their oratorical gift. Special methods which this genius has
at his disposallead to a clear intellect and good memory, to the acquisition
of an excellent gift of perception and a ready wit in
every respect. By jezalel's help the magician can procure for
himself the favour of very important persons, secure for himself
success in love matters, learn about the secret plans of his
enemies, and many other things.
<br><br>Fig. 14: Mebahel- the fourteenth genius, helps to win wars, to
realize plans for peace, he inspires politicians and helps them to
carry out their plans. Being a special friend of justice, this genius
is a protector against injustice and helps to settle legal affairs
righteously. He helps to get prisoners who have been innocently
imprisoned out of prison. This genius will teach the magician the
art of reading other persons' thoughts and, apart from that, how
he can detect and control his persecuters and enemies.
<br><br>Fig. 15: Hanel - The fifteenth genius of the Mercury sphere is
an excellent initiator into occult philosophy, into magic and
quabbalah. In the Mercury sphere itself, he is also an initiator into
evocation. He supplies the magician with means by the help of
which he can protect himself against the negative beings of that
sphere. Hariel teaches the magician to make use, inductively and
deductively, of the influence of the Mercury zone on all three
planes of our existence. Being a great lover of peace, this genius
can bring about the cirumstances, if necessary, that will lead to
peace. If the magician needs the protection of very important persons,
this genius will also be able to give him his assistance.
<br><br>Fig. 16: Hakamiah - is the name of the sixteenth genius of the
Mercury sphere, who, by applying occult means, will help the
magician to honour, renown, glory and riches. If the magician
wishes it, Hakamiah can also make women love him and entrust
him with the secret of treating successfully infertility of women,
and he will also inform the magician of amulets that suit this purpose.
<br><br>Fig. 17: Lanoiah - The magician is taught by the seventeenth
genius how to look - mentally, astrally and physically - into the
past, present and future in the Akasha-principle, especially in
respect of technological inventions. Diverse new inventions in
technology, chemistry and electricity are due to the inspirations
of this genius. His intuition is the cause of the great success of
musicians and composers, in respect of their art as well as in
respect of the audience. Lanoiah is known as an excellent initiator
into the magic of music. The magician will also find in him a
teacher of cosmic metaphysics.
<br><br>Fig. 18: Kaliel - The eighteenth genius is an excellent initiator
into high magic and quabbalah, and the magician who gets into
contact with him can achieve many things with his assistance. He
may, for instance, be told about magic formulae, powerful words,
which, in case of emergency, need only be uttered by the magician
and immediate help from the Mercury beings will be the
result. In magic, such formulae are called magic-quabbalistic
distress call and a magician will make use of them only in case of
great distress, for he can, by using such a distress call, instantly
kill his enemies. Kaliel informs the magician about the various
kinds of magic formulae and their use: for instance, how to
become invisible, mentally, astrally, and, if necessary, also
physically, by saying suitable magic formulae; furthermore, how
to dematerialize oneself mentally, astrally and physically, in
order to become visible again at the furthest possible distance.
Kaliel teaches the magician the art of overbridging time and space
and of becoming a perfect master in the Akasha. If desired by the
magician, Kaliel will reveal to him all herbs and precious stones
necessary for magical science and teach him how to use these
herbs and precious stones in alchemy as fluid condensers and how
to charge the precious stones magically. The magician will find in
this genius a friend, adviser and assistant in many respects.
<br><br>Fig. 19: Leuviah - The nineteenth genius teaches the magician
how to achieve a high intelligence, excellent memory and
marvellous judgement. Should the magician ever take a wrong
step in his actions this genius will help him to compensate for it.
Apart from this, the magician will be taught how to raise or increase
love with men and women, friends and enemies by magicquabbalistic
methods.
<br><br>Fig. 20: Pahaliah - The twentieth genius informs the magician
of the legality of the micro- and macrocosm, initiates him into the
evolution of man and explains to him the true sense of askesis and
magical equilibrium, and, furthermore, also the synthesis of all
religious systems of our earth from the hermetic point of view, so
that the magician is able to separate the chaff from the wheat.
Apart from this, Pahaliah makes the magician realize the diverse
effects of the Divine Virtues on all three planes.
<br><br>Fig. 21: Nelekael- is the name of the twenty-first genius of the
Mercury sphere. He is an excellent initiator into the whole
hermetic science. He helps occult writers by inspiration and by
giving them a great power of imagination. He provides the person
looking for genuine truth with the appropriate means for his
studies and lets him get into contact with a genuine teacher of
magic, a Guru. His methods, instructions and formulae protect
the magician against the negative influences of any sphere. He
gives exact information on the magic powers of herbs and
precious stones that are of special importance in magic and quabbalah
and alchemy, as well as on the effectiveness of the Akashaprinciple
and on the art of reading in it.
<br><br>Fig. 22: Jeiaiel - The twenty-second genius helps the magician
to become respected and rich by magic and quabbalah and also
lets him become famous, should he want it. He establishes success
in profession and in travelling and reveals means of protection
against accidents. A talisman manufactured and worn according
to this genius' instructions will always protect against any kind of
inconveniences. If the magician is born as an inventor, he will find
in this genius, an excellent initiator who, apart from other things,
will allow him to look into the past, present and future for
anything that should interest him.
<br><br>Fig. 23: Melahel -, the twenty-third genius of the Mercury
sphere, entrusts the magician with quabbalistic formulae that will
protect him against any kind of weapon. Amulets manufactured
according to the instructions of this genius protect against surprise
attacks on journeys. Other quabbalistic formulae which this
genius has at his disposal cause the greatest fire to stop instantly,
make one bear the greatest possible heat, without singeing one
single hair on one's body. Since this genius is also acquainted with
herbal medicines he can give the magician excellent resipes for the
preparation of blends of tea and their dosage for the treatment of
diseases.
<br><br>Fig. 24: Hahuiah - The twenty-fourth genius will tell the magician
banning formulae by which he can control dangerous
animals, influence thieves, so that they restore the stolen goods,
influence murderers, in order to make them confess their
shameful deeds. One single word of power is able to completely
paralyze a murderer instantly. With respect to magic and quabbalah,
this genius is an excellent initiator and makes the magician
acquainted with the most diverse magic arts. Since he is also well
acquainted with the magic of formulae, he knows the most
diverse formulae, protecting formulae, some of which the reader
will find in my next work "The Key to the True Quabbalah".
<br><br>Fig. 25: Nith-Haiah - The twenty-fifth genius is, as far as magic
and quabbalah are concerned, the greatest original initiator of the
Mercury sphere, who guards all secret mysteries well. He sees to
it that to no unworthy person is revealed the" Abhisheka" or
knowledge in magic and quabbalah. On the other hand he initiates
a mature magician into the profoundest secret mysteries of
magic and quabbalah and enables him to comprehend the deepest
mysteries of the cosmic orderliness and to make practical use of
its laws. The magician will not only find in this genius an original
initiator into all sciences, but also into the greatest wisdom that
can ever be grasped by a man. Nith-Haiah is the guardian-angel of
all magicians on earth.
<br><br>Fig. 26: Haaiah - The twenty-sixth genius is regarded as a protector
of justice and he helps the magician in contact with him
win any law suit if the magician is right. Being a friend of high
diplomacy, this genius can help the magician to make a speedy
career if he is working in the diplomatic field. The magician also
is informed how to gain the favour of very important people,
how to gain knowledge and riches, how to encounter his enemies,
in order to reveal any treason or secret plans and operations.
<br><br>Fig. 27: Jerathel -, the twenty-seventh genius, can give the
magician an excellent talent for learning languages and procure
for him the favour of friend and enemy. He lets the magician see
in the Akasha-principle what his enemies are planning to do and
how he can protect himself against them. For this purpose, the
genius entrusts him with various banning formulae. If the magician
is a writer, Jerathel can make him a famous man by providing
him with an excellent capacity of perception and showing
him means and ways to achieve this without difficulty.
<br><br>Fig. 28: Seeiah - The twenty-eighth genius can inform the
magician of powerful formulae by which he can, for instance,
cause or stop thunder and lightning, or a terrible thunderstorm,
how to cause a fire over the greatest distance ow how to stop or
localize it, how to destroy completely whole cities and how, on
the contrary, to protect towns and houses in war-time, so that
they remain untouched. You need never worry about any misuse,
since an immature person would never be revealed these secrets.
The magician who has taken up contacts with this genius need
not be afraid of anything, for he is under special protection.
<br><br>Fig. 29: Reiiel - is the twenty-ninth genius of the Mercury
sphere. He makes available to the magician great truths, and he
makes him understand them completely. Besides this, he informs
the magician of the plans of his enemies, no matter whether visible
or invisible, and gives him advice how he can protect himself
against them, how he can make them change their minds to
become his friends. This genius is prepared to reveal to the magician
many secrets which up to this date have remained unrevealed.
He may also be told by Reiiel about the cosmic orderliness
and the correlative effects of its powers.
<br><br>Fig. 30: Omael - is the thirtieth genius in this sequence and a
great friend of the animal kingdom. He is therefore able to inform
the magician of many means which can be successfully applied
to cure sick animals. He is also a friend of physicians,
especially of gynaecologists and surgeons and, if the magician is
active in any of these fields, he will be given excellent skill by this
genius and, apart from this, will be initiated into occult anatomy
and medicine. Omael is also well acquainted with chemistry and
alchemy, and the magician may profit a great deal from him in this
respect. Omael also gives exact information on pre-natal education.
The magician who has got into contact with this genius will
never get into distress and grievance. He will always feel the
favourable influence of his protector.
<br><br>Fig. 31: Lekabel - The thirty-first genius is an initiator into
love magic and all sexual mysteries. Besides this, he can instruct
the magician in quabbalah and talismanology and in the art of acquiring
the most diverse magical faculties by the Akashaprinciple,
or by the use of the light, for instance, clairvoyance,
making oneself invisible, etc. The magician will find Lekabel to
be an excellent teacher in alchemy. Following his instructions,
the magician is able to prolong his life at will. But there are many
other advantages resulting from the contact with the thirty-first
genius of the Mercury sphere. The magician can, for instance,
become a rich man after this genius has made him discover
precious treasures hidden under the earth. The magician learns
how to force thieves by magic to restore the stolen things or to
give themselves up. This genius also unveils the secret of how to
become a talented orator, and many other things.
<br><br>Fig. 32: Vasariah - The magician will find the thirty-second
genius to be a versatile initiator and protector whom he may call
on any time he wishes. He helps the magician obtain his right.
Thieves, robbers, liars will be induced by him to tell the truth; he
can provide one with an excellent talent for talking and instruct
the magician how, by the help of quabbalah, to acquire such
talents. In order to help him in moments of distress, the magician
will be revealed powerful formulae or powerful words by this
genius by which the fiercest aggressor can be made ineffectual.
This genius can instruct the magician in astrophysics, in space
magic and quabbalah, as well as in all other magic arts, and he can
also assist artists in their profession. He may also reveal to the
mature magician magic words by which he becomes invisible and
invulnerable against any kind of weapon.
<br><br>Fig. 33: Jehuiah - The thirty-third genius is a teacher of all
sciences of the earth. He helps the magician to pass successfully
any examinations that he might have to go in for. He allows him
to look into the past, present and future of all things, makes him
recognize his enemies, is able to change hostility into friendship,
to raise love in man and woman and to increase friendship. Furthermore,
he teaches the magician the art of levitation, the practical
application of the law of gravitation in a magical sense, instructs
him in the dematerialization and materialization of bodies
and other objects and in space magic. He reveals to him the
remotest truths and he also assists the magician in solving difficult
magical problems by way of inspiration.
<br><br>Fig. 34: Lehahiah - The magician is told magic formulae for the
calming of tempestuous spirits, so that he eventually becomes
their master and is able to control lightning, thunder and
thunderstorms on land as well as on the sea. If the magician, protected
by this genius, is on a voyage, the ship will resist the
greatest gales and return safely to its harbour. Led by Lehahiah,
the magician will achieve great things. At this special request he
will be initiated by this genius into the remotest Divine Mysteries
and he will be shown many interesting facts about magic and
quabbalah, and thus an almost boundless number of possibilities
will open to him.
<br><br>Fig. 35: Kevakiah - is the thirty-fifth genius, who will show the
magician ways and means to become complete master of all
dangerous influences of negative beings. He turns the greatest
enemy into a friend of the magician, creates peace everywhere
where it is desirable, amongst individuals as well as amongst nations
and peoples. If the magician wants it, Kevakiah will help
him to become rich and honoured.
<br><br>Fig. 36: Menadel -, the thirty-sixth genius, is an excellent initiator
into synthetic astrology. He teaches the magician to apply
his astrological knowledge for spagirical and alchemical purposes;
he informs him at what time and for what purpose he should
manufacture and charge talismans and by which way the desired
powers can be banned into precious stones by force of magic and
quabbalah; he tells him the exact time when he should collect
herbs and the practical application of their power for curing and
for magical practices. This genius is also able to free prisoners, no
matter in whatever kind of jail they may be. This he effects either
by force of magic, i. e. by inciting wardens to open the locks and
doors of the jail, or by an act of mercy. This genius also procures
luck and happiness in one's profession, the favour of very important
persons, and many other things.
<br><br>Fig. 37: Aniel - is the name of the thirty-seventh genius, who is
a friend of poets, writers, playwrights, composers and of
everything that has to do with arts. A magician who is interested
in arts can be sure that this genius will always help him. He may
not only be initiated into all the sciences of this world, but also
into many magic arts. The magician will get more information on
the remotest secrets of nature and on the whole occult
philosophy as well as on the most secret mysteries of initiation into
magic and quabbalah. Aniel awakens in the magician his talent
for translating these high mysteries into the language of the intellect.
<br><br>Fig. 38: Haamiah - This genius is a very popular one in the
Mercury sphere. He willingly opens all spheric treasure chambers
to the mature magician, i. e. he reveals to him the deepest wisdom
and by doing that he leads him to highest bliss. The thirty-eighth
genius makes the magician also bear his earthly lot by strengthening
his health, procuring for him contentment, happiness and
renown. This genius can fulfill the magician any wish.
<br><br>Fig. 39: Rehael - is a special initiator into alchemy and occult
anatomy. The magician is taught by this thirty-ninth genius of
the Mercury sphere the manufacture of the philosopher's stone,
as well by dry as by wet procedure, by which the astral or
physical body can be impregnated and rejuvenated. The magician
is thus able to prolong his life as long as he wants. Rehael is also a
great friend of children and sees to it that child loving persons -
parents - get a lot of children. He gives exact information on all
child diseases and likes to help in such cases. This genius will
awaken love and loyalty in the people that are nominated by the
magician.
<br><br>Fig. 40: Ieiazel - If the magician wants to free someone from
prison or from his enemies, he should refer to the fortieth genius
of the Mercury sphere, who will either give him his direct personal
assistance or have those people influenced by his subordinates
who are able to free the person in question. The things
that the magician can learn from Ieiazel are: the magical dematerialization
and rematerialization of objects over the greatest
distances; the power to influence human beings, animals and
physical objects by the magic of elements; the finding out of the
past, present and future of any person or thing; the transmutation
of enemies into friends; the causing and calming down of
thunderstorms by magic formulae revealed to the magician by
this genius; the curing of psychic disharmonies - melancholies -
by magic formulae, etc. Since Ieiazel is also a good friend of all artists,
he secures success by inspiration and makes them loved by
the audience. The same is the case with the artists that work as
writers and editors of books.
<br><br>Fig. 41: Hahahel - is responsible for strategic success and causes
man to make new inventions in this respect. He also leads to the
discovery of the plans of the enemy. If the extermination of
whole armies or the evocation of storms becomes necessary, this
genius will provide the magician with the necessary magic formulae.
Apart from this, the magician will be taught how to increase
any kind of energy in an astonishing manner, how to
become invulnerable and how to recognize the workings of the
Akasha-principle in the mental, astral and physical world. When
applying the special methods revealed by this genius, the magician
will be able to increase his power to the height of perfection
and to intensify his belief and power of conviction in such a way
that he will be able to work miracles.
<br><br>Fig. 42: Mikael - The magician can be made acquainted by this
genius with magic-quabbalistic methods which will make him
master his enemies, discover their plans and thus anihilate these
before they can ever be realized. He is also taught how to dazzle
his adversaries and to get them headed in the wrong direction
by deception. The forty-second genius helps politicians and
diplomats make a wonderful career and provides them with a
marvelous gift of intuition and presentiment.
<br><br>Fig. 43: Veubiah - This genius teaches the magician to discover
the plans of his enemies and to defeat any purposes directed
against him. Due to the special methods that this genius is able to
reveal to the magician, the latter will become absolute master
over his adversaries. Furthermore, he will learn the art of producing
talismans that offer special protection for the soldier on the
battle field and save him from death, and the art of healing
wounds by magic and quabbalah within a few seconds, and many
more things of that sort.
<br><br>Fig. 44: lelahiah - The forty-fourth genius of the Mercury
sphere entrusts the magician who has got into touch with him
with special quabbalistic methods by which he can make the
blind see, the deaf hear and cure the insane. Moreover, the magician
is instructed by lelahiah in the transmission of things over
the greatest distances and in their withdrawel by means of beings
or dematerialization and rematerialization. He is taught how to
read correct in the Akasha-principle and how to be successful in
any affair and have all his own wishes or the wishes of other people
fulfilled.
<br><br>Fig. 45: Sealiah - enables the magician to recognize all those
people who practice black magic, sorcery and witchraft. He
makes him acquainted with methods which will enable him to
make any aggressor ineffectual, and cover his adversaries with the
so-called magic hood which makes any kind of magical experiment
impossible. The magic manufacture of such a hood which
no black magician is ever able to penetrate is revealed to the magician
by this forty-fifth genius of the Mercury sphere. Similar to
the other genii of this sphere, also Sealiah can make the magician
acquainted with magic words which at the moment of their articulation
cause great earth-quakes that can destroy completely
whole cities. Such magic words will, however, never be revealed
to any human being with low ethical standards, therefore no one
need to be afraid of any misuse. That the magician thus also
becomes the master of land and water need not be emphasized
here. He is capable of forcing thieves to return the goods they
have stolen, of humiliating the arrogant and haughty, of helping
the wronged to his rights. Assisted by this genius, the magician
will be able to carry out all the above mentioned things, for he
will be made master over our earth.
<br><br>Fig. 46: Ariel- This genius can provide the magician with the
faculty of prophecy, can teach him to control completely the
Akasha-principle in respect of looking into the past, present and
future, instruct him to charge volts, and so on. If the magician
wishes to become a rich man, providing he has good reasons for
doing so, this genius will help him discover any of the treasures of
the earth. But this is not all: he will also make the magician acquainted
with the greatest secrets of nature and life. For instance,
he will teach him how to bring about involuntary dreams over
the greatest possible distances, how to charge precious stones
with certain powers, how to propagate all kinds of elementaries
in a magic-quabbalistic manner. Ariel may also make it possible
for the magician to have intercourse with the positive beings of
other spheres and may instruct him about talismans and other
magical arts.
<br><br>Fig. 47: Asaliah - To learn to recognize and understand the
laws of justice and legality, i. e. to maintain a permanent
equilibrium in respect of the worldly as well as the spiritual laws,
is an art in which the forty-seventh genius can instruct the magician.
He can also make the magician comprehend the deepest
secrets, make him behold, in the Akasha, the whole life of any
human being, by looking into his past, present and future.
Asaliah will be pleased to acquaint the magician with the special
methods by which these faculties can be awakened in man. There
is also no doubt about this genius's interest in procuring the magician's
rights in any matter. He is also able to awaken love in
human beings, to increase the sympathy between friends, to
change hostility into friendship, etc. Above that, he is able to
stimulate the favour of important people.
<br><br>Fig. 48: Mihael - The forty-eighth genius of the Mercury
sphere may be regarded as a teacher of alchemy. Especially regarding
transmutation, i. e. the transmutation of metals, this genius
is able to give the magician thorough information. The magician
will be given methods by which he can, if he chooses, change the
electronic oscillation of any metal, i. e. make gold out of the
most inferior type of metal. The magician is also taught to go
about vice versa, if, for instance, he wants to change the gold and
silver of an avaricious person into lead and iron by force of magic
and quabbalah. In the same way it is possible to make precious
stones out of common stones. Furthermore, the magician learns
from this genius: to increase or diminish love and passion in men,
to create atmospheres in which human beings must do what the
magician wants them to do; to cure women from infertility; to
procure peace, concordance and loyalty between married couples,
so that no force in the world, except death, will be able to
separate them.
<br><br>Fig. 49: Vehuel - The magician will be made acquainted by the
forty-ninth genius of the Mercury sphere with all kinds of prophecy,
starting from the most simple ones up to the perfect
reading in the world of the Akasha, and will learn to control
them. Apart from this, he will be taught how to increase his consciousness
to enable him to place himself anywhere he likes, to
read at once the thoughts of any human being, to learn to know
everything in respect of his Aura, and, by doing so, to recognize
his character at a simgle glance, whether he is dealing with a foe
or a friend. The magician may also learn from this genius all
possible ways of influence. Having once got into contact with
this genius, he will be able to spend his life in peace and tranquility.
<br><br>Fig. 50: Daniel - This genius makes it possible for the magician
to look into the workshop of Divine Providence and to perceive
the workings and effects of the Akasha-principle, and, furthermore,
the fiftieth genius will enable the magician to comprehend
the effectiveness of the divine virtues and, by doing this, to influence
within him the vibrations of love and charity. This will
put the magician into a state of happiness which can only be experienced
by persons who have been guided by this genius. There
are even more advantages derived from the connection with this
genius: the magician will learn to differentiate between justice and
injustice, will develop a good sense of judgement, act cleverly in
any matter, be successful as a writer, achieve an excellent talent as
an orator, become witty and enjoy deep intuitions. He will learn
to recognize in any religious system its true philosophical contents.
In case of emergency, the magician will always be inspired
with the right ideas by this genius.
<br><br>Fig. 51: Hahasiah - is one of the original initiators into the
hermetic science. Not only will he provide the magician with genuine
information on magic and quabbalah, but he will also instruct
him in astro-physics, in astro-chemistry and alchemy, initiate
him into the deep mysteries of wisdom and teach him the art
of elevating his spirit into the most various planes and spheres
and to act there consciously. Due to the special methods which
the magician will be given by the fifty-first genius of the Mercury
sphere he will be able to make his mental, astral and physical
body invisible and, apart from this, to change certain causes in the
Akasha-principle in respect of their effects. There are, however,
other advantages the magician will enjoy on account of his connections
with this genius: he will be taught how to produce
various medicines. If the magician deals with medicine, he can
become an excellent doctor, guided by this genius, and will have
great success with his cures and be much loved by his patients.
<br><br>Fig. 52: Imamiah - The fifty-second genius allows the magician
to become the master of his fellow-men, especially of his adversaries,
and he shows him means and ways to make them innocuous.
By lmamiah's help prisoners can regain their freedom,
either by direct magical action or by influencing those people
who can decide on the setting free of a prisoner. lmamiah is a
special initiator into astrology in respect of magic and quabbalah.
Thus the magician may get valuable information from the
teaching of this genius. He may get information on any field of
science existing on earth. Since lmamiah has a special sense for
gaiety, entertainment and pleasure, he brings about situations
which will no doubt satisfy the magician in this respect.
<br><br>Fig. 53: Nanael - Surely, the advanced magician will want to
understand and get under his control any animal. The fifty-third
genius of the Mercury sphere can initiate him into this art, so that
he will understand the languages of all animals. He will, by force
of magic, be able to change his mental and astral body in such a
manner that any animal will perceive him. The magician may
also appreciate being made acquainted with all the laws of magic
and quabbalah. By apt meditations the magician will eventually
penetrate into the deepest problems and acquire many magical
faculties. Many magic methods for the controlling of animals and
elements and the controlling of the astral body of man and animal
may be given the magician by this genius.
<br><br>Fig. 54: Nithael - is the fifty-fourth genius of the Mercury
sphere. Being a great friend of all artists, writers and orators, he
helps them to become famous. He makes the magician a favourite
with very important people on earth and with higher beings,
paves his way to satisfaction and success and leads him to complete
happiness. He is able to inform the magician on any field of
science of this world and is always a ready assistant to the magician.
<br><br>Fig. 55: Mebaiah - The fifty-fifth genius is an assistant of infertile
women insomuch as he can give the magician instructions for
the elimination of the causes of infertility. Mebaiah creates love in
all those cases where it is necessary and he helps the magician to
success, honour, esteem, respect, dignity and authority. He is an
original initiator into genuine cosmic religion and a loyal assistant
on the way to perfection.
<br><br>Fig. 56: Poiel - The magician will get everything he needs for
his living, his studies, his profession, and earthly life, in general,
by the assistance of the fifty-sixth genius, who will always be
pleased to help him. The magician may learn from this genius
everything past, present, and future, and will produce love and
sympathy in all those cases where it should be necessary. The
magician will be told those facts about occult philosophy, magic
and quabbalah, which up to that point have not yet become
known to him, and he will be effectively assisted by Poiel in his
studies.
<br><br>Fig. 57: Nemamiah - The fifty-seventh genius can reveal to the
magician the secret of magical transmutation, i. e. the art of
changing his own astral and mental body or those of other people
into any desired shape. That this faculty is of great importance
and that it provides the magician with valuable possibilities in
respect of his knowledge of magic, need not be specially mentioned
here. Yet another faculty the magician may acquire under this
genius' guidance is the art of magical mummification of the
elements in order to be protected against any kind of influence by
such elements. The magical practices which this genius will teach
the magician will enable him to make blind people see again, to
become clairvoyant, to make his body resist any kind of stress
without difficulty, to be successful in any respect, to overcome
any passion, to awaken love, increase or let it fade away again; to
free imprisoned people, etc. This genius is especially fond of inspiring
technicians and helps them make new inventions,
especially in steel industry.
<br><br>Fig. 58: Jeialel - Being an initiator into sphere magic and
spheric astrology, the magician will be taught great wisdom by
this fifty-eighth genius of the Mercury sphere. He will be made acquainted
with the various powers and effects of the individual

influences for mantic purposes and to make practical use of this
knowledge in magic and quabbalah. Apart from this, the magician
learns to become absolute master over all the beings of the
elements and spheres and how to increase his magic power and
authority.

astro-magic and teaches the transfer of magic powers on precious
stones. He will reveal to the magician who has got into contact

from women. Harahel is a special friend of all gynaecologists,
midwives, etc. This genius is well acquainted with all the earthy
sciences and is therefore able to give the magician exact information
on anything. If the magician is a businessman, and if he is interested
in stock exchange matters, Harahel will give him good
hints as to which papers will be going up and which will fall.
<br><br>Fig. 60: Mizrael - If the magician needs great manual skill in his
profession, he should, by all means, address the sixtieth genius of
the Mercury sphere, who will, no doubt, help him in this respect.
If the magician is interested in the philosophy of religions or in
any other sciences, he can be initiated into all these by Mizrael
and thus become a great scientist by private studies. This genius is
also well acquainted with alchemy, and the magician may learn
from him how to prolong one's life by alchemical spagiric means
and how to mummify one's body and, furthermore, how mental
diseases can be cured successfully. This genius is also very
pleased to give information on divine virtues and their influences
and on the manifold magic faculties. He shows the magician how

alchemy, especially in the use of the elements for various
alchemical purposes to turn water into wine or, vice versa, wine
into water, instruction in the changing of metals, i. e. the

Divine Virtues, the art of meditation and concentration; he
teaches him how to find out the workings and effects of the
Akasha-princip1e, how to become a wise man by studying magic
and quabbalah, how to grasp the essence of any philosophy. Jah-
Hel initiates the magician into various arts, for instance, how to
change a rod into a snake and vice versa, similar to Moses' doings
before Pharaoh, he teaches him how to make all snakes gather at a
certain spot, how to immunize himself against snake poison, so
that even the most pernicious snake cannot do him any harm. If

magic-quabbalistic application, and is instructed in the controlling
of the water element, so that he gets complete power over any

This genius will assist, in word and deed, the magician in
all his operations.

genius. At the same time he is initiated into occult
anatomy and hermetic medicine. He learns about the preparation
of alchemical means against the most diverse diseases. The magician
is also taught to achieve great things by the magic of nature,
for instance, how to restore the fertility of the earth by help of
magic and quabbalah and how, vice versa, to make whole countries
infertile. By Habuiah's help the magician will be able to turn
enemies into friends, to awaken love in human beings of both
sexes and to increase it.
<br><br>Fig. 69: Rochel- teaches the magician how to find, by the help
of the Akasha-principle or by the assistance of beings, any thief,
no matter how cunning he might be and wherever he might have
hidden himself. Special methods will enable the magician to influence
thieves in such a way that they will give themselves up
and restore the stolen goods. He is taught to hinder thieves from
running away and to make them stand stiff like a mummy as lon~
as it seems necessary. The sixty-ninth genius is a patron of justici
and will always see that the magician has his rights fulfilled and
that he wins any lawsuit. This genius may be called at any moment
of distress.
<br><br>Fig. 70: Jabamiah - is an excellent initiator into ceremonial
magic, and the magician is taught by him to cause the greatest
magic phenomena by magic and quabbalah, to read in the
Akasha-principle and to operate by it, and to use the light in a
magical sense in all three planes. He is acquainted with special
methods by which you can learn the art of astral and mental
wandering, the dematerialization and materialization of himself,
of other people and other things, and the faculty of transference
over the greatest distances. The seventieth genius leads the magician
along the way of enlightenment towards highest bliss. The
magician may also be initiated by this genius into all sexual
mysteries, from the making of a baby to the preparation of a
magic volt. Mere words cannot express the advantages a magician
will enjoy if he gets into contact with this genius.
<br><br>Fig. 71: Haiel - Guided by the seventy-first genius the magician
will learn to master any situation, to get out of the worst trouble,
to make his enemies obedient and to help all those who are being
persecuted by foe or fate. Haiel knows methods by which the
magician is able to increase his magic powers as far as possible, so
that at the end he is capable of working miracles. This genius is,
in any respect, an excellent teacher and assistant.
<br><br>Fig. 72: Mumiah - is the name of the last genius of the Mercury
sphere. He is an excellent initiator into magic and quabbalah.
Under his guidance the magician is able to carry out any magical
operation in any sphere. He is made aware by this genius of any
hindrance that might lie on his way and at the same time told
how to overcome it. Since Mumiah is also an original initiator into
alchemy, metaphysics, astro-physics and especially into occult
medicine, he also teaches the magician how to successfully treat
any disease, and by which magic-quabbalistic or alchemical
methods strong health and a long life can be secured. The
seventy-second genius can give information on the production of
the philosopher's stone, on alchemical quintessences, and on
many other relevant things. He is rightly called the patron of all
doctors who deal with magic, quabbalah and alchemy.
<br>*
<br>The informative description of the 72 genii of the Mercury
sphere thus comes to an end. If the magician has learned also to
control this sphere completely, he has, indeed, become a good
magician of spheres. The controlling of the intelligences of the
zone girdling the earth, the Moon sphere and the Mercury sphere
are most essential, since these three spheres are next to the magician
and correspond to all three worlds, i. e. the physical, the
astral and the mental world. The sphere magician is therefore advised
to become absolute master of these three spheres and their
intelligences. During his magical and evocational work the magician
will convince himself that by having contacts with these
three spheres, their intelligences, genii and subordinated beings,
he will be able to achieve anything in such an abundance that a
magically untrained person could not have the slightest notion of
it. To have all wishes fulfilled the magician is offered in this book
a great selection of intelligences and he will not need any other
book.
<br><br>The magician should be aware of the fact that each individual
intelligence described in this book - no matter to which zone or
sphere it may belong - can supply him with such an amount of
knowledge and wisdom, depending on his maturity and development,
that a whole, extremely interesting book could be written
in each case. The short introductory notes given in this book are
only to serve the magician as guiding lines for further practical
work. How many methods and practices, how much knowledge
and wisdom can be gained from it, depends on the magician
alone. However, one thing is quite certain: the sphere magician,
by being in contact with and having control over the intelligences
of the cosmic hierarchy, is travelling along the path to perfection,
and it is therefore possible for him to become a true Adept.
<br><br><strong>6. The Intelligences of the Venus Sphere<A name=venus></A></strong>
<br><br>It will be the next task of the magician to get into contact with
the intelligences of the Venus sphere and to get them - step by
step - also under his complete control. He also achieves this goal
either by way of evocation or by mental wandering. Having done
the three above mentioned spheres first, which, as said before, are
very important, the magician has trained well his magic faculties
by enlarging them and making his spirit superior to everything.
The magician is therefore well prepared for making further contacts
and may confidently try to get into touch with the intelligences
of the Venus sphere.
<br><br>It should be mentioned at the beginning that all intelligences of
this sphere are of a fascinating beauty and power of attraction,
which, unfortunately, has sealed the fate of many a sphere magician,
or has, at the least, hindred him from further development.
<br><br>If the magician allows himself to be enthralled by the extraordinary
beauty of the intelligences of the Venus sphere, he is giving
up his chances for furhter magic development, for he will, in
consequence, again and again be attracted by the Venus sphere
until finally his further intercourse with this sphere will be
equivalent to a pact. Not only the positive, but also the negative
intelligences of the Venus sphere are of diabolic beauty and seductive
character. Thus great steadfastness is needed to recist their
temptations.
<br><br>The Venus sphere has an oscillation intoxicated with love,
which puts any sphere magician into a state of happiness that may
be compared with an ecstasy of love, so that he is often tempted
either to remain in that sphere with his mental body - which, no
doubt, would cause his physical death - or to visit that sphere
again and again. If the magician is overcome by such temptations
he by and by becomes completely enthralled by this sphere and
will find it hard to get out of it again. His development to perfection
then becomes quite impossible for a long time, if not for his
lifetime. The magician, however, who has worked systematically
at his development and who has worked himself through the
above mentioned spheres in the order suggested and thus gained a
strong character and a complete magical equilibrium and become
master over his faculties and qualities, having reached a state of
spirit superior to everything, can confidently travel to higher
spheres including the Venus sphere. Therefore every magician
should first test himself to see if he has the necessary maturity,
power and steadfastness.
<br><br>Below is a description of ninety intelligences of the Venus
sphere with whom I have been in contact formerly and whose
names and seals might only be known to a few sphere magicians
and initiates. Besides these intelligences, there are a few others in
the Venus sphere about whom other authors have written in
their books, for instance Hagiel, and which have not been included
in this work, since their names and seals are generally known
and easily obtainable. In order not to make this volume too large,
the positive intelligences are described only in a few words, for it
is possible for the sphere magician to get. into personal contact
with every single intelligence and to enlarge his knowledge by
practical work.
<br><br>In general, the seals of the Venus intelligences have to be drawn
in green colour at the time of the first evocation. Also in this case
the magician must be careful to reproduce the signs in the same
colours as given in the appendix of this book. The graduation, in
analogy to the zodiac, which can be found under each seal, is the
key to the relevant influence of each intelligence on our zone
girdling the earth, and from there on man in all three planes, i. e.
his mental, astral and physical bodies. This knowledge is of great
importance from the point of view of the astro-quabbalistic
Science.
<br><br>1) Omah, 2) Odujo, 3) Obideh, 4) Onami,
5) Osphe, 6) Orif, 7) Obaneh, 8) Odumi. - These eight intelligences of the
Venus sphere have all the same
range of power. They may be regarded as excellent initiators into
erotic and sexual mysteries. They completely control the electrical
and magnetic fluid, especially with regard to the magic of
love. The magician may learn from these intelligences how to
practise sexual magic with the help of these fluids, how to produce
love amulets, in which way the oscillation of the Venus
sphere can be created; and they like to inform the magician about
many other magical practices.
<br><br>9) Orula, 10) Osoa, 11) Owina, 12) Obata,
13) Ogieh, 14) Obche, 15) Otra. - The intelligences numbered 9-15 are
initiators with regard to the
fertility of men and women. They are representatives of peace
and of marital happiness. Assisted by these intelligences, the
magician can awaken love between men and women, can secure
the favour of men and women, and achieve everything that has to
do with love and propagation.
<br><br>16) Alam, 17) Agum, 18) Albadi, 19) Aogum,
20) Acolom, 21) Achadiel 22) Adimil, 23) Aser. - This group comprising
eight intelligences is given the task of
controlling, supporting and realizing, in accordance with the instructions
given by Divine Providence, the divine ideas of
philosophy, inspiration, art, beauty, music and all relevant
talents.
<br><br>24) Aahum, 25) Acho, 26) Arohim, 27) Ardho,
28) Asam, 29) Astoph, 30) Aosid. - The range of power of these seven
intelligences covers the acquisition
of magical faculties, personal beauty, power of attraction,
knowledge of the magic of mummies with regards to love,
etc. A magician is readily informed by these intelligences on how
to acquire various magical faculties by love magic. They are inspirers
in respect of love and its realization, not only for beings of
the zone girdling the earth, but also for beings of other spheres.
<br><br>31) Iseh, 32) Isodeh, 33) Idmuh, 34) Irumiah
35) Idea, 36) Idovi, 37) Isill, 38) Ismee. - This group of eight
intelligences teach the magician to cause
friendship, love, sympathy, in all spheres and planes by force of
magic and quabbalah, applying, for this purpose, apt rituals,
ceremonies and gestures.
<br><br>39) Inea, 40) Ihom, 41) Iomi, 42) Ibladi
43) Idioh, 44) Ischoa, 45) Igea. - This group consisting of seven
intelligences of the Venus sphere
is commissioned with the task of awakening and increasing intellectual
faculties of making beauty, love, harmony perceptible,
and explicable in all languages of the intellect. The range of power
of these intelligences also covers the control, inspiration and
realization of art and of all kinds of inventions.
<br><br>46) Orro, 47) Oposah, 48) Odlo, 49) Olo,
50) Odedo, 51) Omo, 52) Osaso. - These seven intelligences control the
laws of harmony in the
animal and vegetable kingdoms. They explain to the magician the
influences of the Venus sphere on these two kingdoms, not only
on our planet but also on all other planets of the universe. The
range of power and knowledge of these intelligences includes the
control and regulation of growth and fertility on all planets.
<br><br>53) Ogego, 54) Okaf, 55) Ofmir, 56) Otuo,
57) Ohoah, 58) Ocher, 59) Otlur, 60) Ogileh. - The above named eight
intelligences inform the magician of the
technical inventions of the human beings living on Venus and
other planets. Above that, the magician is given details about all
laws that are in force on the planet Venus.
<br><br>61) Gega, 62) Gema, 63) Gegega, 64) Garieh,
65) Gesa, 66) Geswi, 67) Godeah, 68) Guru. - The above eight intelligences
initiate the magician into the laws
of the Positive and Negative principles. Furthermore, they instruct
him in the effectiveness of the Divine Virtues on the Venus
planet and in the Venus sphere. Apart from this, they reveal to
the magician special methods which, by mummification of the
oscillation of the Venus sphere in the magic-quabbalistic manner,
bring about the favour of the beings of the Venus sphere as well as
of the beings of all other spheres. These intelligences inform the
magician also of many other theories and practices in magic and
quabbalah.
69) Gomah, 70) Goldro, 71) Gesdri, 72) Gesoah
73) Gescheh, 74) Gehela, 75) Gercha.
These seven intelligences allow the magician a glance into the
workshop of Divine Providence, and the magician perceives the
effectiveness of Divine Providence or of the Akasha-principle on
the Venus planet and the Venus sphere. Helped by these intelligences,
the magician may behold the whole history of evolution of Venus and
its sphere. The magician is also instructed in
quabbalah by these intelligences.
<br><br>76) Purol, 77) Podme, 78) Podumar, 79) Pirr,
80) Puer, 81) Pliseh, 82) Padcheh, 83) Pehel. - This group of eight
intelligences teach the cosmic language and
its use in the Venus sphere. At the same time the magician is informed
about the correlative influences of the individual spheres
on the Venus planet and on its sphere and is also instructed in the
practical application of these facts in magic and quabbalah.
84) Pomanp, 85) Pitofil, 86) Pirmen, 87) Piomal,
88) Piseph, 89) Pidioeh, 90) Pimel. - The magician is instructed by
these intelligences in the divine
orderliness of the universe, especially with regard to the Venus
shere, in its laws, symbolism, etc. These intelligences can, furthermore,
initiate the magician into spheric quabbalistic magic and its
relation to love. The magician learns to evoke a state of happiness
and ecstasy of love by using the quabbalah and magic having
value in the Venus sphere. There are many other things that these
intelligences can teach the magician who has got into contact
with them.
<br>*
<br>These short descriptions and hints will no doubt be sufficient
for the experienced magician. I could, of course, give a more
detailed picture of each individual intelligence, but must,
however, desist from doing so for technical reasons. A full
description of the whole range of competence of each individual
intelligence of the Venus sphere in its relation to each planet and
sphere, to man, to the powers of the World of Causes, their working
methods, etc., would fill a whole book. It must therefore be
left to the magician to gather practical experience from personal
contacts with these intelligences. The magician, however, is once
more warned about getting into permament contact with just one
intelligence, however beautiful that intelligence may be, however
intelligent it may be, for by and by this would be of disadvantage
to the magician and would slowly result in a standstill on his way
to perfection.
<br><br>When the magician steps onto the Venus planet, he will realize
that this planet is inhabited by beautiful human beings who, apart
from that, are, in comparison to man on earth, more advanced in
knowledge and wisdom, in magic, art, literature, technology, etc.
The magician will be able to enlarge his knowledge greatly and
will be taught many valuable teachings, methods, and hints under
the seal of secrecy. A trained magician who by mental wandering
is able to roam the planets and spheres with his mental body will
also find men on the Venus planet who have been initiated into
magic and quabbalah and he can, if he wishes, get into contact
with these. Unlike the other inhabitants of the planet, he will not
even have to take on the shape of a Venusian; the initiates there
will, nevertheless, be able to perceive him and explain to him
everything that he is interested in. Every magician will be astute
enough to keep everything that he has learned a secret, for in the
eyes of non-initiates his statements would not only be regarded as
fairy-tales, but they would be regarded as fancies that would cause
people to laugh at him.
<br><br><strong>7. The Genii of the Sun Sphere<A name=sun></A></strong>
<br><br>Assuming that the magician has become master over the Venus
sphere, that in spite of having got into contact with at least a few
of its intelligences, he has not become a victim of their temptations
and that he has a good control over the vibrations of this sphere
and the preceding spheres, he can go a further step and learn to
know and control the Sun sphere.
<br><br>The vibration of the Sun sphere is different from that of the
Venus sphere, and not every sphere magician is capable of staying
long in this sphere, especially should he travel through it with his
mental body on his mental wanderings. To give a detailed
description of the vibrations of the Sun sphere would take much
time. The magician will, however, become acquainted with its
vibrations by numerous visits to that sphere: he will slowly learn
to master it and be able to stay longer in it in order to get into
contact with the genii there. Initiates regard the Sunsphere as the
so-called Light Sphere. It is the sphere of our cosmos that is most
difficult to control. When the magician has learned to know and
to control it well the following spheres will represent no difficulty
to him, and it will be easy for him to get them under his contro1.
<br><br>A short description of the genii of the Sun sphere is to give the
magician further guiding lines for his practical work. The seals of
these genii have to be drawn in a golden yellow colour at the time
of their first evocation. The graduation that is given under each
seal has the same meaning as the one of the Venus sphere. To be
well informed about the influence that each genius has on the
zone girdling the earth, and from there on to our planet, is, from
the quabbalistic point of view, most important.
<br><br>The Sun sphere influences alllife in all the spheres and on all
the planets. With regard to man, this influence becomes, as
already mentioned in the description of the Mercury sphere and
its cosmic orderliness, obvious in the degree of vitality by which
the mental, astral and physical bodies are kept together.
<br><br>The Sun sphere is ruled by a total of 45 genii. Their ruler, called
"Master of the Sun Sphere" in the hermetic language, is named
Mettatron in quabbalah. In the original quabbalistic scriptures
Mettatron is called the mediator between God and man.

<br><br>Fig. 38: Erab - The thirty-eighth original genius is regarded as
the original initiator and is, at the same time, a guardian of time
and space on all planets of our universe.
Note: The sphere magician knows that time and space only exist
where there are physical shapes and created things, no matter
whether so-called dead or living creatures. Contrary to it all
spheres starting from the zone girdling our earth up to the
highest spheres of our cosmic hierarchy - but not their planets -
are timeless and spaceless.

<br><br>Fig. 42: Levem -, the forty-second genius, is to be regarded the
original creator of all magical science and of quabbalah.
<br><br>Fig. 43: Vasat - is an original initiator into the water principle
and its magnetic fluid in all grades of density and effectiveness on

<br><br>Fig. 44: Ezhabsab - All creatures living in water, on our earth
as well as on all other planets, are under the influence of the fortyfourth
Sun genius.
<br><br>Fig. 45: Debytzet - is the name of the forty-fifth genius of the
Sun sphere. All means of evocation, and, apart from this, all processes
of combustion, including fermentation, are controlled by
this genius.
<br><br>Judging from their range of power, the original' genii of the Sun
sphere are to be regarded, in the cosmic hierarchy, as the
mediators of the Original Creator of the planetary system. For
the reader's information, and in order to gain a better survey, I
have only given an abstract idea of each genius.
In relation to the effect of these abstract ideas there exist many
parallels which the magician will arrange intuitively himself or he
receives the according enlightenment during his contact with the
genii of the Sun sphere. In any case the magician will attain that
much knowledge that there is a lack of words to tell anything
about it in detail.
<br><br>As soon as the sphere magician is master of the Sun sphere there
exists no problem any more which he would not be able to solve
in the right way. His knowledge has no gap and by means of this
spheres he is able to become a perfect Adept. For a magician acquainted
with quabbalah it becomes now clear why the quabbalistic
initiations tell that the connection with the Godhead will
be accomplished on Tiphareth, which is the Sun sphere according
to the quabbalistic Tree of Life, in which the magician can obtain
the union with God.
<br><br>As is told in the Tree of Life literally the magician must have
covered half of the way to God, that means he must have control
over the spheres until the Sun sphere inclusive, whereupon God
will go to meet him in the second half, so that it comes to the
union with God. In this case it is not a connection with a personified
God but knowledge and wisdom, might and power will
be united to one.
<br><br><strong>8. The Intelligences of the Mars Sphere<A name=mars></A></strong>
<br><br>The magician who has honestly struggled through the Sun sphere
and who controls it as well as the other preceding spheres will
now find it easy to roam the following three spheres and get them
under his control.
<br><br>The next sphere in the hierarchy is the Mars sphere, which is
influenced by such powerful intelligences that it would be very
dangerous for any magician who has not brought under his control
the preceding spheres to evoke them. For this reason and also
because one could do much harm, for instance, from the point of
view of talismanic magic, and also in the use of the seals of the
Mars intelligences regarding their power, dynamics and appearance,
I desist here from publishing the seals of the individual
positive intelligences of the Mars sphere. Only the names and the
graduation I want to state. The experienced sphere magician will
get into contact with some of these intelligences during his mental
wanderings, in order to learn about their seals, names and
range of power. By doing so, I can never be made responsible for
any misuse of the seals by an immature person, for the Mars intelligences,
even the positive ones, can cause a person's instant
death if called or evoked without the necessary precautions and
preparations. Apart from this, many seals could be misused for
erotic purposes. The person interested in genuine knowledge will
understand my attitude to give only the names of the intelligences,
for the mature one my information will suffice.
<br><br>The expert in astrology will know that the Mars sphere, in its
effectiveness, prevailingly adheres to the Mars principle, for passionate
love, eroticism, supernatural power of man, wars, etc., depend
on the influence of the Mars sphere. For the reader's information
it is pointed out in this connection that the negative intelligences
living in the Sun and the Mars sphere are the most
dangerous ones of our whole cosmic hierarchy. Under their range
of effectiveness come: murder, homicide, robbery; fires, destruction,
etc.

<br><br><strong>9. The Genii of the Jupiter Sphere<A name=jupiter></A></strong>
<br><br>The magician will not try to get into contact with any of these,
unless he has completely succeeded in getting at least a few of the
intelligences of the Mars sphere under his power, who - as has
been pointed out in the preceding chapter - are all very difficult
to control. The vibrations of the Jupiter sphere are far easier to
stand up to than the ones of the Sun and the Mars sphere.
<br><br>Therefore the sphere magician will find it easy to get into contact
also with the genii of the Jupiter sphere. Their range of power is
very large, and their influence, which is somehow of an abstract
nature, penetrates all subordinated spheres right down to the
zone girdling our earth and has its effects on all three planes: the
mental, the astral and the physical plane.
<br><br>The sphere magician who has become acquainted with all the
preceding spheres, either by evocation or by mental wandering,
and got into contact with individual beings, genii and intelligences
will, no doubt, now be convinced that he can achieve
and gain more, regarding knowledge and wisdom, by mental
wandering, i. e. with his mental body, in the individual spheres
and therefore also in the Jupiter sphere than by merely calling beings,
genii and intelligences to our earth by help of evocation. This
is, however, not to say that the magician should not practise
evocation. Quite the contrary: it is advisible to practise both
methods and to try to have an equally perfect command of both.
If, however, the magician is interested in special problems,
especially spiritual ones, if he wants a better conscious assimilation
of subtleties, he will always prefer to visit the spheres, in this
case the Jupiter sphere, by mental wandering.
<br><br>Influenced by the vibrations of the Jupiter sphere, the
magician's consciousness is expanded; he can penetrate deeper into
the truths revealed to him by the genii, can understand them
better and can, without special effort, transfer the gained truths
into his physical consciousness after having returned into his
physical body, in our physical world. Besides this, the magician
will find it easy to express, in the language of the intellect, the
knowledge he has gained in the Jupiter sphere. Only practice will
teach the sphere magician with which sphere inhabitant he
should get into contact by mental wandering and with which one
he should do so by evocation.
<br><br>Of all the beings, angels and genii of the Jupiter sphere, twelve
are regarded as the highest ranking ones, due to their unlimited
range of power. Their influence works on the whole cosmic
hierarchy, i. e. on all the spheres, planes and planets and their inhabitants.
<br><br>Each of these twelve original genii has a certain relation
to our zodiac, and their laws of analogy are identical to all spheres
and planes of our cosmic hierarchy. At the time of their first
evocation, the seals of the Jupiter genii have to be drawn in blue
colour.
<br><br>Fig. 1: Malchjdael - Aries - is the first genius of the Jupiter
sphere, who keeps in equilibrium the electric fluid of the whole
cosmic hierarchy. His job is to enliven everything created in all
three kingdoms of our earth and the zone girdling the earth.
Malchjdael controls and directs the will and the activity of every
human being and all other creatures. If the magician gets into contact
with this original genius, he can be informed about
everything regarding this and, apart from this, he will be made acquainted
with methods which will enable him to increase or
decrease activity at his will by force of magic and quabbalah.
Following the directions given by this genius, the magician is
capable of creating such a strong state of belief by magic and
quabbalah that he can work miracles in the cosmic world due to
this intensified activity. Besides this, Malchjdael can initiate the
magician into the original element of fire in all its aspects and
analogies in the microcosm and macrocosm, and give him directions
and methods regarding the complete control of this original
element in all its phases by magic and quab&alah, in order to
become absolute sovereign of activity in the microcosm and
macrocosm. There are, however, many more laws, wisdom and
kinds of knowledge regarding activity, electrical fluid, original
fire element, principles of light, etc., with which this original
genius may not only make the magician acquainted, but which
the latter may also get under his control by an apt Abisheka, i. e.
an apt transfer of power.
In sphere magic, this original genius is one of the most powerful,
and no magician should fail to get into contact with him,
since he will, by this connection, gain a power in the cosmic
hierarch.y that no other intelligence of any other sphere, perhaps
with the only exception of the Uranus intelligences, could give
him.
<br><br>Fig. 2: Asmodel - Taurus - is the second original genius of the
Jupiter sphere. He is responsible for the direction and control of
the original principle of cosmic love with all its aspects and
analogies, in all spheres and on all planes and planets of the hierarchy.
The magician who gets into contact with this original genius
will be made capable of perceiving the deepest mysteries of love
not only in its emotional and intellectual aspects, but also from
the point of view of wisdom. This original genius explains to the
magician how any kind of cosmic vibration of love can be caused
in any sphere, no matter whether by evocation or mental
wandering, whether by magic or by quabbalah. All miracles that
can be caused and realized in love matters by magic and quabbalah,
i. e. not only in our own physical world or in the zone
girdling our earth, but also on all other planets and in all other
spheres, are made available to the magician by this genius. All the
ways of holiness which behold Divinity under the aspect of love
are directed by Asmodel, and the conscious sphere magician is instructed,
theoretically as well as practically, in all the aspects. The
magician interested in the mysteries of cosmic love existing in the
whole cosmic hierarchy will find this genius to be the best initiator.
<br><br>Fig. 3: Ambriel - Gemini - is the third original genius of the
Jupiter sphere, who has under his command all knowledge of the
whole cosmic hierarchy. He is the supervisor of the mind, of the
intellect, i. e. of all theoretical knowledge in all fields of science.
Ambriel directs the maturity for knowledge, the capacity of
perception of each being in the whole cosmic hierarchy. Taking
into consideration the grade of maturity and development, this
genius not only directs the intellectual power of perception and
the intellectual faculties of the individual, but of the total of the
inhabitants of all planets. Under his range of competence come all
the sciences and arts on all planets which have to do with the
mind and intellect. The magician who has got into contact with
this genius will be made acquainted, depending on the grade of his
development, with a kind of knowledge which truly is only accessible
to such initiates that have learned to work consciously
with the Jupiter sphere by force of the Akasha-principle.
<br><br>Fig. 4: Murjel - Cancer - The fourth genius of the Jupiter
sphere has to control and keep in equilibrium the total magnetic
fluid in the cosmic hierarchy. He is responsible for the fluid state
on all planets and also for the element of water in the whole
cosmic hierarchy, including our world, in its physical, astral and
mental state. The magician can be fully instructed by this original
genius in the original element of water, its workings and effects,
regarding the whole cosmic lawfulness and in respect of magic
and quabbalah, and furthermore, in the way by which, under the
influence of the magnetic fluid, certain occult faculties can be
wakened and developed in the mental body, for instance,
transcendental seeing in all spheres and on all planets. This
original genius can teach the magician many other things. The
sphere magician who has a perfect command over the magnetic
fluid can work miracles by its help, miracles which the noninitiate
would never be able to imagine.
<br><br>Fig. 5: Verchiel - Leo - The whole life spending original principle
of the whole cosmic hierarchy, on the planets as well as in the
spheres, is controlled by the fifth original genius of the Jupiter
sphere. Alllife in all spheres and on all planets, including our
earth, is directed by him, no matter whether life in the vegetable,
the animal or the human kingdom is concerned, or whether man
in his physical, astral or mental body is in question. If the magician
gets into contact with this original genius, he will be instructed
by him in the highest form of magic and quabbalah,
which refers to the whole cosmic hierarchy. Verchiel reveals to
the magician special methods and practices by which he can get
under his control the highest power in the whole cosmic hierarchy.
Apart from this, all miracles which can be caused by belief
and the power of conviction come under this genius' range of
power.
<br><br>Fig. 6: Hamaliel - Virgo - The sixth original genius is in
charge of all chemical original principles, original elements, in the
whole cosmic order. The magician who gets into contact with
Hamaliel can get detailed information not only about the
chemical elements so far known on our earth, but also about
unknown elements which probably will not be discovered before
the far distant future. If the magician is interested, he can also
learn the relevant facts about the elements existing on all other
planets of the whole cosmic hierarchy and, what is more, he can
be instructed in the practical magic and quabbalistic application
of the radiation of each original substance of our planetary
system, in its mental, astral and even physical shape. This makes
it possible for the diligent magician to become, by training, a
perfect master of the original chemical elements due to the exact
methods and instructions given him. He thus becomes a magical
quabbalistic alchemist equipped with a kind of knowledge of
which the key to practical application is known to only a few
Adepts on our earth.
<br><br>Fig. 7: Zuriel - Libra - The seventh original genius of the
Jupiter sphere controls the principle of fertility on all planets
with vegetation and living creatures. Helped by Zuriel, the magician
can learn to understand fully the principle of fertility of the
whole cosmic hierarchy. Special methods revealed to the magician
by this original initiator enable the former to work miracles
by magic and quabbalah at his will. The magician can, for instance,
make water flow out of a rock like Moses, turn a desert into
paradise and so on. But the sphere magician, after having been
initiated by this genius, would also not find it difficult to work a
miracle the other way round within a few seconds. He is then
able to evoke many other miraculous things regarding the principle
of fertility at his will. It is also quite clear that Zuriel, the
seventh genius of the Jupiter sphere, can thoroughly explain to
the magician also the sexual mysteries of the cosmos in all its
phases, kingdoms and spheres. Special treatment of this matter is
therefore not necessary.
<br><br>Fig. 8: Carmel - Scorpio - The eighth genius controls and
directs the original principle of radiation of the whole cosmic
hierarchy, in mental, astral and physical respects. The magician
who gets into contact with Carbiel can reveal, by magic and quabbalah,
or by magical quabbalistic metaphysics, any secret of the
whole cosmic hierarchy in this respect, and he realizes how the
various laws of the original principle of radiation can be applied
in practice. The magician who is able to control the original principle
of radiation becomes the absolute ruler of the microcosmic
and macrocosmic hierarchy and he is then free to make practical
use of his power according to his own ideas.
<br><br>Fig. 9: Aduachiel - Sagittarius - The control and direction of
the original legality, of justice and equilibrium, i. e. of the perfect
harmony in the whole cosmic hierarchy, in all spheres and on all
planets of our universe, is in the hands of the ninth genius of the
Jupiter sphere. The magician may be instructed by this genius in
the highest wisdom and deepest mysteries of divine law, justice
and equilibrium. At the same time he is taught by Aduachiel to
apply all laws of the universe by magic and quabbalah, without
causing any disturbance in its equilibrium.
<br><br>Fig. 10: Hanael- Capricorn - The karmic original principle of
the whole cosmic hierarchy has been controlled, from the beginnings
of time, by the tenth original genius of the Jupiter sphere, on
all planets and in all spheres. The magician taking interest in this
particular matter can be informed of the effects of the karmic
laws in all spheres and planes and he will learn how, from the
magical quabbalistic point of view, the original karmic principles
and their laws can be made use of in the various spheres.
<br><br>Fig. 11: Cambiel - Aquarius - The original principle of
crystallization, condensation and hardening, in the whole cosmic
hierarchy, in our whole universe, is controlled by the eleventh
original genius of the Jupiter sphere. Moreover, this genius is also
responsible for the regular cycle of all planets and therefore also
for gravitation, the force of gravity, the power of attraction itself.
The magician can be informed by Cambiel about all the secrets of
crystallization, not only on our planet, but also on all the other
ones. This means from the magic-quabbalistic point of view that
the magician will be taught to change by alchemy, magic and
quabbalah the principle of solidification throught diminished or
enlarged vibration, depending on the qualities of the substance, so
that he is finally able to change, if he wishes, a gravel stone into a
diamond, or, vice versa, a diamond into a gravel stone, thus making
use of the knowledge acquired from Cambiel. Furthermore,
the magician is instructed by this original genius in the laws of
alchemy in its most subtle form, especially with regards to the so-
called dry process. He is also informed of the practical application
of gravitation from the magic-quabbalistic point of view. If a
sphere magician so wishes, he can make the biggest pieces of rock
as light as a feather and he is able to make light things so heavy
that no force on earth is able to lift them up. This means that this
original genius can easily explain to the magician any problem of
levitation and that he knows many various methods by which the
magician can acquire these faculties, and he will be pleased to
inform the sphere magician about them.
<br><br>Fig. 12: Jophaniel- Pisces- The original principle of evolution
on all planets, in all spheres and on all planes - the mental, astral
and physical plane - of the whole cosmic hierarchy is controlled
by the twelfth original genius of the Jupiter sphere. This genius is
directing development and maturity in all spheres and on all
planets. It is difficult to describe by words what experience and
what gains the magician will make when he gets into contact with
this genius. He will be equipped with a kind of profound
knowledge and wisdom that scarcely can be comprehended by
the intellect of a non-initiate.
<br><br><strong>10. The Saturn Sphere<A name=saturn></A></strong>
<br><br>The Jupiter sphere does not bring us to the end of the descriptions
of the planetary system of our cosmos. The next sphere to
mention is the Saturn sphere. Like the Mars sphere, this sphere is
very hard to contact, and only a well trained sphere magician
should dare to embark upon it after having gone through different
initiating systems with a few original intelligences and after
having gathered much experience, during the course of many
years, in mental wanderings to the individual spheres and thus
feeling almost at home in them.
<br><br>Not every human being is strong enough to stand up against
the oscillations of the Saturn sphere, since they have the depressing
quality of a nightmare. The Saturn sphere is, in fact, the socalled
Sphere of Karma. Its intelligences may be regarded from
man's rational intellectual point of view, the Judges of all beings,
planets and spheres. From the magical quabbalistic point of view,
direct contact with any of these judges has no practical value. If,
however, the magician considers himself mature enough and well
acquainted with the spheres, he might as well try to get into contact
also with the intelligences of the Saturn sphere. I desist,
however, from giving any description of the individual intelligences
of the Saturn sphere, even from mentioning their
names and seals, for it could so happen that some presumptuous
human being, without thinking of the consequences, would dare
to call up a Saturn being by evocation. If the person is, in such a
case, not strong enough ro resist the vibration of that Saturn intelligence,
not only his physical, but also his astral death becomes
unavoidable. Therefore a general description of this sphere will
suffice for the mature and wise, and such will, in spite of such a
short description, be able to get a clear picture of the effectiveness
of the Saturn sphere.
<br><br>The few Saturn intelligences that have been mentioned in
known books written by authors such as Agrippa, Khunrath, and
others, are not the highest intelligences of this sphere and have, in
general, only a subordinated range of competence when compared
with the genuine original intelligences of the Saturn sphere,
forty-nine in number. The already known intelligences named
Agiel, Arathron, Cassiel, Machatan, Uriel, etc., have, therefore,
not much importance in the Saturn sphere and are by no means
original intelligences. However, they show a certain affection for
the zone girdling the earth, are friendlier with the magician and
therefore also easier to get into contact with. What these intelligences
can offer the magician in respect of magic and quabbalah,
the latter is sure to get to know much more from the intelligences
of any other planet's sphere. I am talking in this
respect from the point of view of personal experience, and every
magician is able to find out the truth of these words himself.
What, for instance, Arathron can offer the magician, each of the
360 heads of the zone girdling the earth can also do, without the
magician having to travel to the Saturn sphere. The same is true
of Agiel and the other so-called intelligences of the Saturn sphere
mentioned in the common grimoires. During wanderings, in my
mental body, through the Saturn sphere a long time ago, I personally
came across Agiel and Arathron and conversed with
them, so I am recording here personal experience.
<br><br>As far as the 49 original intelligences of the Saturn sphere are
concerned, it should be mentioned that they are responsible for
the original Karmic principle of all spheres, especially for the doings
and effectiveness of all the negetive beings of each sphere,
beginning with our physical world. In accordance with Divine
Providence, they allow for the bad effects of negative beings.
They are in charge of the powers and effects of the principle of
destruction in the whole cosmic hierarchy. They see that justice
is done and - depending on the approval of Divine Providence -
let negative effects become reality by their subordinate beings.
The Saturn intelligences allow wars not only on our planet, but
wherever love and hate exist; they let the negative principle
work up to a certain point and they are the ones that have to
judge rigorously upon human beings and beings of all spheres in
accordance with divine orderliness and legality. Therefore the
Saturn intelligences are regarded as the so-called Judges and Executers
of Fate in the word's highest sense. Moreover, they decide
upon how long magicians who have concluded a pact with beings
negative or positive - have to remain under the power of the
relevant beings.
<br><br>Each original intelligence of the Saturn sphere has a certain
range of power: they have each a certain planet and a certain
sphere under their command. If the sphere magician is interested
in learning about the range of effectiveness of anyone original initiator
of the Saturn sphere, about his influence and subordinated
planet, he can get exact information from a subordinated intelligence
like Agiel or Arathron. From what has been said here,
the magician will gather that he need not actually avoid the
Saturn sphere, but he will less care to contact its 49 original intelligences.
It is not a pleasure to see the doings of negative beings
or to watch mentally how they are controlled and punished.
One needs strong nerves and a strong mental steadfastness to do
that. So much about the Saturn sphere. The seals of Agiel,
Arathron and the other inferior intelligences of the Saturn sphere
are generally known. Every magician will take heed not to reveal
the names and the seals of the 49 original intelligences of this
sphere to any immature person and will fully understand why
I desist from giving details.
<br><br><strong>11. The Spheres of Uranus and Pluto<A name=uranus></A></strong>
<br><br>With the Saturn sphere the description of the general magic of the
spheres has been concluded, i. e. the hierarchy of the seven
spheres known to us has been sufficiently explained. However,
the genuine initiate who has learned to move about with his mental
body in the universe at will and to his heart's desire, and to
resist, in his mental body, the different oscillations and vibrations
of each sphere will have found out for certain that there exist,
beyond the Saturn sphere, numerous other spheres, which have
no direct influence on our earth or on the zone girdling our earth;
at least not to any extent that it would make it worth considering
from the point of view of magic and quabbalah.
<br><br>The first sphere worth mentioning after the Saturn sphere is the
Uranus sphere, the small influence of which only reaches as far
down as the Moon sphere. If a magician, acquainted with the
magic of the spheres, is on a visit in the Moon sphere, he will be
able to feel there the effects of the Uranus sphere. In the zone
girdling the earth this sphere is also known, but its influence
hardly ever penetrates far beyond the Moon sphere: it usually
fades away and ends in the latter sphere. This stated fact has, of
course, nothing to do with the astrological interpretation of the
planet Uranus, which cannot be dealt with in this connection.
The Uranus sphere will not have any influence on the zone girdling
the earth and on our planet before the next cycle of evolution
takes place. Nevertheless, the magician will find, in the Uranus
sphere, intelligences who can initiate him into the magic and
quabbalah of the macrocosm. To give the reader any details here
is not possible, since the time for their disclosure has not yet
come. However, it is worth mentioning in this connection that
true initiates call proper quabbalah the Uranian, i. e. the Cosmic
Language. This means that magic and quabbalah and their practical
application are controlled and directed in the whole
macrocosm - i. e. in our cosmic hierarchy - by intelligences of
the Uranus sphere in accordance with the universal laws. It
therefore rests with the intelligences of the Uranus sphere to
decide to what extent each being, each original intelligences of the
other spheres is able to apply any kind of quabbalah and magic or
to teach their applications to magicians.
<br><br>The sphere magician who gains a firm footing on the Uranus
sphere gets into contact with the original intelligence there and is
initiated by them into magic and quabbalah; nothing else can be
given to him by any other initiate, any other initiator of whatever
sphere or plane, for such a magician has become a perfect Adept, a
genuine master, a hierarchic magician and quabbalist. He has
become master not only of the zone girdling the earth, but also of
all spheres and kingdoms. He who has proceded this far into
sphere magic and has also exhausted the Uranus sphere may say
with justice of himself that he is a perfect Adept, who fully comprehends,
in the human sense, the Book of Wisdom with its 78
leaves - tarot cards - and perfectly controls its law in the
microcosm and macrocosm. To such an initiate I also cannot offer
anything else.
<br><br>From this short description of the Uranus sphere the initiate
will eventually gather how long the way to perfection is. It is here
that our hierarchy ends.
<br><br>Beyond this there exists another sphere, the Pluto sphere; but
the magician, in his present state of development, cannot profit
anything from that sphere, for it will have no effect on the zone
girdling our earth before the so-called Second Day of Brahma, the
next cycle of evolution. The surface of our earth will then be inhabited
by quite a different race of people, who will have a diffent
skin colour and different laws from ours.
<br><br>During travels in the mental body, I have come through various
other spheres besides the ones already mentioned, about thirty in
number. But these spheres, in their present state of evolution,
have no significance for us human beings, nor for the zone girdling
our earth; for they do not come under the range of power of
our hierarchy. The extent of this book does not allow any kind of
description of those spheres.
<br><br>The magician will realize that beyond our universe, our
macrocosm, our planetary system, beyond the hierarchies and
spheres that have been described in this book, there exist many
other, much greater universes, which adhere to quite different
forces, laws and analogies than our macrocosm. To give a detailed
description of all these is without exaggeration, impossible.
<br><br><strong>12. Intercourse with Beings, Genii and Intelligences of all
Spheres by Mental Travelling<A name=inter></A></strong>
<br><br>This chapter may not be necessary for the sphere magician.
However, not every reader will be able to put to practice at once
all that he has read in this book. Many of the readers may first
want to enlarge their theoretical learning. It is for them that these
lines will serve as stimuli for enriching their knowledge. The
author's book "Initiation into Hermetics" contains exact instructions
in mental travelling. Also, the astral body's exteriorisation,
or so-called projection of the astral body, is dealt with in detail,
in theory and practice. The magician will not be able to travel any
further than the zone girdling the earth in his astral body, since
the astral matrix is composed of the substance of the elements
which, at the most, are able to resist the oscillations of the zone
girdling the earth. Thus the magician will not imagine that he can
place himself, in his astral body, beyond the zone girdling our
earth, for this is something that is impossible. The sphere magician
with practical experience will know that the astral body is
confined by Divine Providence to the laws of the zone girdling
the earth, and that it cannot break these laws. Moreover, the
astral body depends on the space principle. The magician will
find this verified when visiting the zone girdling the earth.
<br><br>The magician can place himself with his astral body into the
world of the elements and visit any place on our planet, no matter
whether on or under the earth; his astral body is even able to
resist the most subtle oscillations of the zone girdling the earth,
but he will soon realize that he cannot go any further than this
zone. If he dared to leave it in his astral body, with his physical
body meanwhile lying on the physical plane, remaining in contact
with the astral body by the astral matrix, the experiment
would result in the instant splitting of the astral matrix and the
magician's instant physical death. It would then be useless to try
to revive the astral matrix; the physical body having become a
victim of the elements. If, on the other hand, it so happened that
the projection of the astral body should succeed in spite of the
magician's physical death, and that the mental body together
with the astral body were to penetrate beyond the zone girdling
the earth by force, the mental matrix would rend asunder: the
mental body would be parted from the astral body, the latter again
becoming a victim of the elements in the astral world, which
would consume such a dead astral body within a short period of
time. It would then be impossible for the magician to return to
his astral body and his spirit would be banned in the sphere appropriate
to his last state of development. Such an act of force
committed by a magician would be severely punished by the
jugdes of the Saturn sphere.
<br><br>A similar act of force and catastrophe is the conscious separation
of the astral matrix from the physical body, or of the mental
matrix from the mental body, which has already been termed in
the Bible as "a sin against the spirit". The true meaning of the
words "against the spirit" from the hermetic point of view is only
known to few people. For it is true that such cases are rare.
Generally, the urge for self-preservation is the reason why the
bounds are hardly ever exceeded in this respect. Moreover, each
magician has an intelligence acting as his guardian angel who
warns him in time from such karmic catastrophes. This explanation,
in a way, also throws light on the Faustus tragedy, which is
quite clear to every initiate.
<br><br>Here are a few facts with respect to mental travelling: The
sphere magician who has absorbed the author's first work "Initia-
tion into Hermetics" has learnt how to separate his mental body.
He has been told at the beginning of this book, the author's second
work, that in practice this is only possible if he has a perfect
command of the facts laid down in book one. The magician has
learned to set free his mental body and to wander first into the
mental sphere of our physical world. After sufficient practice he
extended his visits to the astral plane around our physical world
and after that he became capable of visiting, with his mental
body, any place of our physical world where he wished or desired
to be, where he wanted his spirit to be placed. Then he visited the
kingdoms of the elements, having taken on, for that purpose, the
shape of the beings of the elements by force of imagination, thus
enabling them to see, hear and feel him. One after the other he
visited the kingdom of the gnomes, the kingdom of the undines,
roamed the regions of the air with its sylphs or fairies and finally
travelled through the kingdom of the salamanders to get also that
region under his control. After that the magician learnt to elevate
his mental body into the planes, above all filled with the desire to
get to the zone girdling the earth. After some training his mental
body rose into a vertical position and the magician saw himself
transferred to that zone, according to his wish.
<br><br>Having reached the zone girdling the earth, the oscillations of
which the magician's mental body successfully resisted, the magician
soon was surrounded by beings of that zone. Later he was
able to get to know, one after the other, the heads of the zone
girdling the earth, whose names and seals are contained in this
book, thus taking up contact with them. They made the magician
acquainted with all the facts regarding that zone and taught him
how he could get to the plane next to theirs, i. e. the Moon
sphere. The magician is able to betake himself to the Moon sphere
without a guide: he must at first get his mental body influenced
with the colour of the Moon sphere, i. e. get it dyed silvery white,
with a slight touch of violet. As soon as he has his body completely
impregnated with the accumulated light of silvery white and
slightly violet colour, he is again raised into a vertical position,
this time wishing to wander to the Moon sphere. When first trying
to raise himself from the zone girdling the earth into the
Moon sphere, the magician will have the sensation of a rotary motion.
Repeated training will take this feeling of dizziness from him,
and the feeling of pressure in the solar plexus region will also
cease. The elevation itself is instantaneous: suddenly the magician
finds himself in a sea of light of a silvery-violet colour and is
already placed into the Moon sphere. His desire to get into touch
with the intelligences there does not remain unfulfilled. If the
magician calls, in this silvery coloured vibration, for one of the intelligences
mentioned and described in this book, he will soon see
it appear. The contact is the same as in the zone girdling the
earth.
<br><br>If the magician wants a being from another sphere to do a certain
thing, he should work out his plans first in the zone girdling
the earth and should not betake himself to the relevant sphere
without having sufficiently pondered the matter. For during his
initial operations his consciousness usually loses its independence
by the different colour vibration of the sphere. Only by repeated
intercourse with the same being will the magician get used to the
pressure he experiences in that sphere and his independent thinking
will no longer be influenced by it to such a great extent.
<br><br>After the magician has had experience with all of the 28 intelligences
of the Moon sphere he will have become complete
master of it and he can then change its influence within himself
by either increasing or diminishing its vibrations, in order to suit
the extent of power of the beings he is getting into contact with.
During his initial visits to the moon sphere the magician will
become aware that its 28 original intelligences possess a power of
radiation, an inner expansiveness, that almost paralyses his mental
body. In order to be able to stand up to this influence, the
magician must take on a vibration suiting the original intelligences
of the moon. This is done by an appropriate condensation
of light power of the Moon sphere whilst the magician is still
in the zone girdling the earth, for otherwise the magician could
not get into contact with these intelligences without having to
fear the accompanying effects of paralysis.
If the magician has become thoroughly acquainted with the
Moon sphere, he travels, in his mental body, to the next sphere,
the Mercury sphere, after having influenced his mental body in
the Moon sphere with the yellow-orangecolour oscillation of the Mercury,
i. e. after having accumulated the light power of the Mercury
zone. He then gets into contact with the individual genii of
the Mercury zone, one after the other, in much the same way as
he has done previously with the intelligences of the Moon sphere.
After repeated elevation to the Mercury zone it is no longer
necessary for the magician to get there via the Moon sphere, for
he now can impregnate his mental body with the Mercury vibration
whilst still in the zone girdling the earth and he may travel
from there directly into the Mercury zone. If he succeeds in getting
into contact with at least thirty genii of that zone, he is able
to carry out the elevation into the Mercury zone straight from
our physical world, i. e. by carrying through the colour impregnation,
i. e. the accumulation of light power with the Mercury
vibration, about his physical body; and he can directly and
at once betake himself to the Mercury zone, without having to
use the zone girdling the earth or the Moon sphere as transit stations.
During his intercourse with genii of the Mercury zone the
magician will not feel such a strong paralysing effect of their
radiation power, since the Mercury zone is, in a way, analogous
to the mental body, as has been shown under the chapter dealing
with the cosmic hierarchy. The magician should not think of
betaking himself into the next sphere, unless he has become absolute
master over these three spheres, i. e. the zone girdling the
earth, the Moon sphere and the Mercury zone.
<br><br>The reason why I pay so much attention to these three spheres
is, as already pointed out, firstly because the zone girdling the
earth has an analogous connection with the physical body, with
its fate; secondly because the Moon sphere has a similar connection
with the astral body, with its maturity, its character, its
equilibrium, etc.; and thirdly because the Mercury zone has a
similar connection with the mental body.
<br><br>In the Mercury zone, the stepping-stone for travels to higher
spheres, the sphere magician then carries through the accumulation
of light power from the next sphere, the Venus sphere,
before he betakes himself to it. The accumulation of the light
power of the Venus sphere must result in a wonderful emerald
green colour. If he has not become a victim of the temptations in
the Venus sphere and has thus become a master of love, he can
place himself directly from this physical world into the sphere in
question. He must, however, carry out the accumulation of the
light power of the Venus sphere in his mental body already beside
his physical body.
<br><br>The same naturally also applies to the next sphere, the Sun
sphere, which is the sphere that is most difficult to reach as the
beings of that sphere all have such a strong accumulation of light
that the magician who has not provided for a sufficient accumulation
of the light power of the Sun, i. e. an accumulation
equivalent to the glowing Sun, cannot resist the vibrations of the
Sun genii. If the magician got into touch with a genius of the Sun
without having sufficiently prepared himself by an appropriate
light impregnation of his mental body, the glowing power of
light rays would throw him back into his physical body and his
mental matrix would, as a consequence, loose its equilibrium; and
disharmonies would be the inevitable result. Such disharmonies
would soon become obvious by various accompanying effects in
the astral body, sometimes even in the physical body. Under certain
circumstances a nervous breakdown would be the result. But
also other psychic disadvantages might show up. Therefore the
magician will consider my warning absolutely necessary and
realize that it is not possible to betake oneself into other spheres
without knowing their laws of analogy and their application and
without having a sound knowledge of the magic of evocation.
After having got the Sun sphere absolutely under his control,
the magician will visit the adjacent sphere of Mars. In order to
avert any danger from the beginning, only the names, not the
seals, of the intelligences of that sphere have been published in
this book. The Mars sphere has a light vibration of a ruby-red colour.
This means that the accumulation of the light power for the
mental body must also result in a ruby-red colour. Every magician
who has learnt to master the Sun sphere without any risks
may visit all the spheres that lie beyond it, one after the other,
with only one exception: the most dangerous sphere of Saturn.
Visits to the Jupiter sphere are carried out in the same way, except
for the accumulation of light power, which has to result in a
sky-blue colour.
<br><br>Should the magician also want to visit the Saturn sphere, he
must carry out the appropriate accumulation of light power for
his mental body in a dark violet colour.
Regarding the Uranus sphere, the accumulation of light power
for the mental body has to be lilac-coloured, and for visits to the
Pluto sphere, the last sphere of significance, it has to be coloured
in a light grey.
<br><br>The other spheres are colourless. The magician who has proceeded
this far and has learnt to carry out the accumulation of
light powers of the spheres may visit the other planets without
any special colouring of his mental body and get into contact
with the intelligences living there. As soon as he gets near the
sphere he plans to visit, he will perceive, by force of transcendental
clairvoyance, the colour of that sphere, thus being able to
carry through the appropriate accumulation of light power in the
universe, before entering the sphere in question. There exist
oscillations the colours of which cannot be compared with any of
the colours known to us and which therefore cannot be described.
Nevertheless, the transcendental eye sees them and can cause
the appropriate light oscillation to be evoked in the mental body,
making the contact with that sphere and the beings living there.
This short description may be sufficient for the genuine initiate.
Details in this respect have never been published in hermetic
literature, and up to now only few initiates are acquainted with
this knowledge. The sphere magician who has learnt to carry
through all this in practice knows that the preceding chapters
contain no fancy stories, for he is been able to convince himself of
the truth whenever he wishes. I have written down only my personal
experience.
<br><br><strong>13. Magical Talismanology<A name=talisman></A></strong>
<br><br>In Part I of this book short instructions for the charge of
talismans and amulets were given together with hints for their
practical application. It seems, however necessary to remind the
reader of a few instructions here, adding to them others which
may be new to the magician. In this last chapter I have decided to
write about talismanic magic and those details which have to be
considered. Much has already been written about talismans yet
much more could be said about it from the hermetic point of
view, though I must cut short here for technical reasons.
The experienced magician will find everything that is said
about this theme familiar and understandable. Looking at it from
the hermetic point of view, a talisman is the means, the medium
or material shape by which a force, a faculty, a power, an influence,
etc. can be bound. There are various ways for binding
such a force. But first a few words about talismans.
<br><br>The magician has learnt how to get into contact with a being, an
intelligence, a genius, etc. He has been shown the four possible
ways:
<br><br>1. mental travelling, 2. evocation, 3. passive intercourse as
described in the book "Initiation into Hermetics" in the chapter
dealing with spiritism, and 4. talismans.
<br><br>As for the shape of the talisman, it can be a piece of jewelery, a
ring, a stone, an amulet, a locket, etc. But also other forms may be
chosen for talismans; the ones stated above are, however, the
usual types. The best way for the magician to go about it is to
manufacture the talisman by himself alone, right from the beginning,
i. e. from its fluid state, as molten metal, up to its charging.
<br><br>If this is not possible, if the magician lacks 'the necessary skill, etc.,
he should have the talisman manufactured by someone else, but
only in its basic, its raw shape. After the talisman has been
brought into its intended shape, the magician starts with the actual
talismanic magic by making a genuine talisman, a genuine
medium, out of it. The seal of the intelligence whom the magician
wants to get into contact with is engraved upon the metal. If the
magician cannot do this himself, he can have it done by a conscientious
engraver or goldsmith. The object to be used as talisman
or amulet is now ready to be magically impregnated. The magician
may also, if he wants, take into consideration the astrological
signature when preparing, respectively impregnating, the
talisman. The wealth of existing astrological literature will make
it easy for him to work out favourable stars influences. When
choosing the metal for the talisman, the astrological analogy of
the relevant zodiacal sign has to be considered. Since the zodiacal
signs were also mentioned in the chapter dealing with the hierarchy
of the spheres, it will be easy to choose the kind of metal that
is appropriate to the zodiacal sign of the genius that has been
selected by the magician. But it is also possible to choose metals in
analogy to the planetary spheres (see table below).
<br><br>The best metal one can use for the beings, genii and intelligences
of all the spheres is the so-called Electro Magicum, an
alloy of the metals that are appropriate to all the planets as
described in the author's first book "Initiation into Hermetics",
in the chapters dealing with fluid condensers. Such an alloy is best
suited for the beings of the zone girdling the earth and for the beings
of the elements in the kingdom of elements. But also wood,
hard wood, or lead may be used for the zone girdling the earth.
<br><br>Regarding the Moon sphere and its 28 intelligences, silver
should be used for producing the talisman. This is done in accordance
with the planetary laws of analogy.
<br><br>For the Mercury zone use brass
<br>For the Venus sphere copper
<br>For the Sun sphere gold
<br>For the Mars sphere iron
<br>For the Jupiter sphere tin
<br>For the Saturn sphere lead
<br><br>For the other spheres tin or silver may be used. The analogies
given above in respect of the metals to be chosen for the production
of talismans are of a general nature. They are only to be
taken into consideration by the magician who wants to work
with astrological analogies. The well-trained and experienced
magician will, in general, find two types of metals sufficient, i. e.
he will use gold for beings of prevailing electric character and
silver for beings of magnetic character. He uses both metals for
neutral beings, for beings that are neither active nor passive, that
neither have an electric nor a magnetic fluid. In this case, two
small plates, equal in size, one made of gold the other made of
silver, have to be soldered together, so that one side of the
talisman is of gold, the other of silver, - if the talisman has, for
example, the shape of a pendant.
<br><br>However, for a good initiate and an experienced sphere magician
the question of chosing the right type of metal is of minor
importance. He is able to impregnate magically and successfully
any object with an intelligence of any sphere, since the magical
contact and the impregnation of the objects the magician chooses
depend on his magical development and maturity.
<br><br>Adepts usually have only one favourite metal which they prefer
for the charging with intelligences: they use pure gold. But, of
course, this is not really necessary. Any common kind of
talisman, with a perfect magicial impregnation, does the same duty
as the one produced of pure gold or jewels.
<br><br>The next thing the magician has to do is to carry out the
magical impregnation of the talisman. This is the most important
work when charging a talisman, for it is by this act that the
talisman becomes the appropriate implement for getting into contact
with the being or intelligence the magician has in mind.
Below the magician will find a specimen of the procedure for carrying
out a magical impregnation.
<br><br>After having chosen the being, genius or intelligence that seems
to suit his purposes due to its magical or other qualities, it is best
to start with a being of the zone girdling the earth, and after having
engraved its seal upon the metal chosen for this purpose, the
magician has to free the talisman by the four elements from all
unfavourable influences which have mentally clung to it when it
was materially formed into shape. This is done by swinging the
talisman a few times over a burning candle with the imagination
that the flame burns away, i. e. destroys, all negative influences.
<br><br>Moreover, the talisman has to be dipped into a glass filled with
pure water where it has to remain for a whole day, the magician
having concentrated on the wish that the water may draw out of
it any bad influences. After a day the magician takes the talisman
out of the water again, throwing the latter away with the imaginative
wish that all the unfavourable influences will flow away
with it. Now he swings the talisman through the air in rotary motions,
concentrating on the imagination that also the element of
the air will take away all negative influences from the talisman.
<br><br>Then the magician puts a handful of earth into a piece of filterpaper
ami, after having added the talisman to it, he rolls it
together, so that he can hold it in his hand. Now he must concentrate
on the idea that also the element of the earth, which now
surrounds the talisman, will tear away from it all negative influences
that might still cling to it. After the magician has concentrated
deeply enough and come to the conviction that the last unfavourable
influences have been pulled out of the talisman by the
element of the earth, he takes the talisman out of the earth, cleans
it with a piece of cloth that has never been used before and wraps
it into a piece of dark violet silk. The filterpaper and the earth
that was used for this operation must then be buried away in a
place that is not easily accessible. During this procedure the
talisman has been cleaned, from the hermetic point of view, by
help of the elements: this means that no element clings to it any
longer, and that therefore no element will influence its charge.
<br><br>If the magician wants to include astrological aspects, he will
keep the talisman in the dark violet silk till the astrological hour
approaches. When that hour has come he will carry out the charge
of the talisman. He will re-draw the engraved seal with a new
needle, concentrating on the wish that by this re-drawing he bans
the being's interests or attention into the object before him. During
this procedure the magician can, again and again, repeat in his
mind the name of the intelligence in question and imagine that
the intelligence is transfering, at that moment, its influence to the
talisman. The physical preparations, the "getting into contact" as
it is called from the hermetic point of view, have now come to an
end; the first step of magic impregnation has been done. Now
there exist many possibilities of charge.
<br><br>The most effective way of charge is carried out by evocation,
i. e. by summoning the intelligence before the magic circle by appropriate
rituals and by asking it to approve of the talisman lying
in or before the magic circle, i. e. to promise the bearer of the
talisman to assist him at any time. If the intelligence gives the promise
of doing the bearer of the talisman this favour, the magician
has achieved what he wanted and the talisman has thus been
charged. However, the magician must make sure that before using
the talisman he takes all the measures that the intelligence
might have recommended him. For the intelligence may, for example,
take precautions by asking the bearer of the talisman to do
some kind of ritual with it every day, to speak certain formulae
over the talisman, or to draw certain signs with it, or to name certain
names necessary for the maintenance of the talisman, or to
keep certain things a secret, and so forth.
<br><br>If everything necessary was taken into consideration when the
talisman was charged, its bearer can achieve the same effects with
it as lie could do by personal contacts which he might have started
by mental travelling or evocation. The above way of charging a
talisman is one of the most effective methods in talismanic impregnation
for getting into contact with a certain intelligence. But
it usually happens that the intelligence in question - when this
method is used for getting into contact with it - only sends its
subordinated servants to have them bound to the talisman and
their names revealed to the bearer. The desired effects are afterwards
brought about by them whenever their names are pronounced
or a certain concerted signal is given.
<br><br>Another way for impregnating a talisman is as follows: The
contact with the intelligence is taken up by repeated imagination
of its qualities; the magician has to concentrate these qualities into
the metal, he has to keep in mind that in this case time, space and
effects are terminated. This method of impregnation makes it
necessary for the magician to have imperturbable confidence and
he must, furthermore, have sufficient magic power to force the
intelligence to do his will, i. e. to bring about the desired effects.
Another possibility is to carry out the impregnation by the
help of a ritual. This is done by drawing the intelligence's seal in
the air with the talisman in hand and by concentrating on the
realization of the effects that are to be brought about. The quabbalist,
however, is aware of the fact that such a ritual would have
to be repeated at least 462 times before the desired contact is effected
and the talisman really becomes magically efficacious.
<br><br>The next method for impregnation is the so-called charge with
magic volts, using, for this purpose, the electromagnetic fluid.
The volt is charged, after its creation, with an electromagnetic
fluid. The qualities of the intelligence in question are concentrated
into the centre of the volt by help of imagination, imperturbable
confidence and sure power, and are so condensed by
repeated action that the metal of the talisman absorbs the volt.
When the process of charging by volts is repeated, the magician
has to concentrate on the wish that the intelligence in question is
connected to that particular volt and that it will bring about by it
the desired causes in the Akasha-world, and with them the desired
effects.
<br><br>There is another way of charging a talisman: the one by sexual
magic. But to avoid any misuse, this method is not dealt with in
detail here. The magician who has been initiated into the high
mysteries and to whom, therefore, everything is clean and sacred,
will, no doubt, know how the plus and minus in man and
woman can be used for the magical impregnation of a talisman by
the help of volts.
<br><br>The quabbalistic method is the last possible way for impregnating
a talisman. The magician who has been initiated into
quabbalah may avail himself of this method. He pronounces the
name of the intelligence in question quabbalistically over the
talisman that has been prepared to be charged. By this action the
intelligence's qualities are transferred into the talisman.
<br><br>The details of such a magic quabbalistic charge of a talisman
will be known to every initiate who has followed all the instructions
up to this point and who has learnt to get into contact with
any intelligence, no matter to whatever sphere it may belong,
providing that he was taught by some intelligences about the
quabbalah.
<br><br>My third book, entitled "The Key to the True Quabbalah"
will, however, give the reader the details in this respect. So much
about the impregnation and charge of talismans, and the basis of
magical talismanology. The mature reader will find this information
sufficient, to the immature ones this science will have remained
a secret.
<br><strong>EPILOGUE<A name=epilogue></A></strong>
<br>I herewith deliver my second work to the reader, the expert and
the sphere magician in the making. This work describes distinctly
the practice of the second tarot card, I have already pointed out
that I could describe much more amply the contents of all the
chapters - if this could be possible from purely technical reasons.
<br><br>Whoever, guided by my first work "Initiation into Hermetics",
has acquired the required stage of maturity by conscientious
study and by spiritual training, will find the contents of this work
fully sufficient for his further practice. By intercourse with single
intelligences of the spheres - be it by mental travelling or by
evocation - the mature magician will be given the chance to
reach the highest peak of magic and of quabbalah, if he chooses
for his initiator a congenial intelligence - being, genius - working
according to his direction and to old established practices. Of
course the magician will not keep to one intelligence only, but he
will travel mentally trough all spheres as well as come to know
them evocatively.
<br><br>I can heartily congratulate those sphere magicians who, on the
strength of this work have gone through practically all spheres,
dominating their forces and establishing contacts; for they have
advanced a fair part on the road to perfection. It will be already a
satisfaction for me to help those who are for the present only
theoretically interested - for they will have much enlarged their
theoretical knowledge after perusing my work. Thus every
reader, every theorist, and foremost, everyone interested in the
secret knowledge, will come to the conviction that magic and
especially, sphere magic, is no witchcraft or sorcery but the peak
of attainable knowledge, surmounting all other intellectual
sciences and being the very crown of wisdom.
<br><br>Those who are not mature and thus cannot conceive even
theoretically, let alone practically - this high knowledge, will
become conscious of their lack of maturity and will abstain from
any criticism.
<br><br>Even if only a few human beings are able to go through this
course, my second work will have fulfilled its intended purpose.
For my books do not belong to the literature which is only
read and which afterwards is left to get covered with dust in
libraries and corners of bookcases; quite the contrary, my works
are distined to serve as a guide and aid to those who have grown
up to hermetics and high Adeptship through the coming centuries.
In the course of time millions of human beings will keep to
the indicated methods of teaching, putting them into practice to
promote their own development and strive steadily after perfection.
